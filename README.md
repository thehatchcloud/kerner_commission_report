# The Kerner Commission Report Repository

This repository contains the text from the "Report of The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders," published March 1st 1968, as found in [The Eisenhower Foundation's website](http://www.eisenhowerfoundation.org/kerner_report).

I'm transcribing the report here because I cannot find a copy of the report online anywhere that is in some text readable format - the Eisenhower Foundation copy is a scanned PDF of the original published report.

If anyone reading this finds a text copy somewhere that is acccessible, or finds any errors with this transcription, feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request.
