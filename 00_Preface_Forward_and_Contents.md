# Report of The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders

March 1, 1968

> ...The only genuine, long-range solution for what has happened lies in an attack - mounted at every level - upon the conditions that bree despair and violence. All of us know what those conditions are: ignorance, discrimination, slums, poverty, disease, not enough jobs. We should attack these conditions - not because we are frightened by conflict, but because we are fired by conscience. We should attack them because there is simply no other way to achieve a decent and orderly society in America....

Lyndon Baines Johnson
Address to the Nation
June 27, 1967

## Forward

This report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders responds to Executive Order 11365, issued by President Lyndon B. Johsnon on July 29, 1967, and to the personal charge given to us by the President.

"Let your search," he said, "be free * * *. As best you can, find the truth and express it in your report."

We have sought to do so.

"This matter," he said, "is far, far too important for politics."

This was a bipartisan Commission and a nonpartisan effort.

"Only you," he said, "can do this job. Only if you * * * put your shoulders to the wheel can America hope for the kind of report it needs and will take to its heart."

This has been a working Commission.

To our staff, headed by David Ginsburg, Executive Director, to his deputy, Victor H. Palmieri, and to all those in government and private life who helped us, we are grateful
