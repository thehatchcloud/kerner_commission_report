# REPORT OF THE NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMISSION ON CIVIL DISORDERS 

> ....The only genuine, long-range solution for what has happened lies in an attack — mounted at every level — upon the conditions that breed despair and violence. All of us know what those conditions are: ignorance, discrimination, slums, poverty, disease, not enough jobs. We should attack these conditions — not because we are frightened by conflict, but because we are fired by conscience. We should attack them because there is simply no other way to achieve a decent and orderly society in America... 

Lyndon Baines Johnson 
Address to the Nation 
July 27, 1967 

## Foreword 

This report of The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders responds to Executive Order 11365, issued by President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 29, 1967, and to the personal charge given to us by the President. "Let your search," he said, "be free ... As best you can, find the truth and express it in your report." 

We have sought to do so. 

"This matter," he said, "is far, far too important for politics." 

This was a bipartisan Commission and a nonpartisan effort. 

"Only you," he said,, "can do this job. Only if you... put your shoulders to the wheel can America hope for the kind of report it needs and will take to its heart." 

This has been a working Commission. 

To our staff, headed by David Ginsburg, Executive Director, to his deputy, Victor H. Palmieri, and to all those in government and private life who helped us, we are grateful.

## SUMMARY 


Introduction 

The summer of 1967 again brought racial disorders to 
American cities, and with them shock, fear and bewilderment 
to the nation. 

The worst came during a two-week period in July, first in 
Newark and then in Detroit. Each set off a chain reaction in 
neighboring communities. 

On July 28, 1967, the President of the United States estab- 
lished this Commission and directed us to answer three basic 
questions: 

What happened? 

Why did it happen? 

What can be done to prevent it from happening again? 

To respond to these questions, we have undertaken a broad 
range of studies and investigations. We have visited the riot 
cities; we have heard many witnesses; we have sought the 
counsel of experts across the country. 

This is our basic conclusion: Our nation is moving toward 
two societies, one black, one white — separate and unequal. 

Reaction to last summer's disorders has quickened the move- 
ment and deepened the division. Discrimination and segrega- 
tion have long permeated much of American life; they now 
threaten the future of every American. 

This deepening racial division is not inevitable. The move- 
ment apart can be reversed. Choice is still possible. Our 
principal task is to define that choice and to press for a national 
resolution. 

To pursue our present course will involve the continuing 
polarization of the^ American community and, ultimately, the 
destruction of basic democratic values. 

The alternative is not blind repression or capitulation to 
lawlessness. It is the realization of common opportunities for 
all within a single society. 

This  alternative  will  require  a commitment to  national 

1 


action— compassionate, massive and sustained, backed by the 
resources of the most powerful and the richest nation on this 
earth. From every American it will require new attitudes, new 
understanding, and, above all, new will. 

The vital needs of the nation must be met; hard choices must 
be made, and, if necessary, new taxes enacted. 

Violence cannot build a better society. Disruption and dis- 
order nourish repression, not justice. They strike at the free- 
dom of every citizen. The community cannot — it will not— 
tolerate coercion and mob rule. 

Violence and destruction must be ended — in the streets of 
the ghetto and in the lives of people. 

Segregation and poverty have created in the racial ghetto 
a destructive environment totally unknown to most white 
Americans. 

What white Americans have never fully understood — but 
what the Negro can never forget — is that white society is 
deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions created it, 
white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it. 

It is time now to turn with all the purpose at our command 
to the major unfinished business of this nation. It is time to 
adopt strategies for action that will produce quick and visible 
progress. It is time to make good the promises of American 
democracy to all citizens — urban and rural, white and black, 
Spanish-surname, American Indian, and every minority group. 

Our recommendations embrace three basic principles: 

• To mount programs on a scale equal to the dimension of the 
problems; 

• To aim these programs for high impact in the immediate future 
in order to close the gap between promise and performance; 

• To undertake new initiatives and experiments that can change 
the system of failure and frustration that now dominates the 
ghetto and weakens our society. 

These programs will require unprecedented levels of funding 
and performance, but they neither probe deeper nor demand 
more than the problems which called them forth. There can 
be no higher priority for national action and no higher claim 
on the nation's conscience. 

We issue this Report now, five months before the date called 
for by the President. Much remains that can be learned. Con- 
tinued study is essential. 

As Commissioners we have worked together with a sense 
of the greatest urgency and have sought to compose whatever 
differences exist among us. Some differences remain. But the 
gravity of the problem and the pressing need for action are 
too clear to allow further delay in the issuance of this Report.

Part I — What Happened? 

Chapter 1 — Profiles of Disorder 

The report contains profiles of a selection of the disorders 
that took place during the summer of 1967. These profiles are 
designed to indicate how the disorders happened, who par- 
ticipated in them, and how local officials, police forces, and 
the National Guard responded. Illustrative excerpts follow: 

NEWARK 

... It was decided to attempt to channel the energies of the 
people into a nonviolent protest. While Lofton promised the 
crowd that a full investigation would be made of the Smith 
incident, the other Negro leaders began urging those on the 
scene to form a line of march toward the city hall. 

Some persons joined the line of march. Others milled about 
in the narrow street. From the dark grounds of the housing 
project came a barrage of rocks. Some of them fell among the 
crowd. Others hit persons in the line of march. Many smashed 
the windows of the police station. The rock throwing, it was 
believed, was the work of youngsters; approximately 2,500 chil- 
dren lived in the housing project. 

Almost at the same time, an old car was set afire in a parking 
lot. The line of march began to disintegrate. The police, their 
heads protected by World War I-type helmets, sallied forth to 
disperse the crowd. A fire engine, arriving on the scene, was 
pelted with rocks. As police drove people away from the station, 
they scattered in all directions. 

A few minutes later a nearby liquor store was broken into. 
Some persons, seeing a caravan of cabs appear at city hall to 
protest Smith's arrest, interpreted this as evidence that the dis- 
turbance had been organized, and generated rumors to that effect. 

However, only a few stores were looted. Within a short period 
of time, the disorder appeared to have run its course. 
»•■»'•* 

... On Saturday, July 15, [Director of Police Dominick] Spina 
received a report of snipers in a housing project. When he arrived 
he saw approximately 100 National Guardsmen and police offi- 
cers crouching behind vehicles, hiding in corners and lying on 
the ground around the edge of the courtyard. 

Since everything appeared quiet and it was broad daylight, 
Spina walked directly down the middle of the street. Nothing 
happened. As he came to the last building of the complex, he 
heard a shot. All around him the troopers jumped, believing 
themselves to be under sniper fire. A moment later a young 
Guardsman ran from behind a building. 

The Director of Police went over and asked him if he had 
fired the shot. The soldier said yes, he had fired to scare a man 
away from a window; that his orders were to keep everyone 
away from windows. 

3 


Spina said he told the soldier: "Do you know what you just 
did? You have now created a state of hysteria. Every Guardsman 
up and down this street and every state policeman and every city 
policeman that is present thinks that somebody just fired a shot 
and that it is probably a sniper." 

A short time later more "gunshots" were heard. Investigating, 
Spina came upon a Puerto Rican sitting on a wall. In reply to a 
question as to whether he knew "where the firing is coming 
from?" the man said: 

"That's no firing. That's fireworks. If you look up to the 
fourth floor, you will see the people who are throwing down 
these cherry bombs." 

By this time four truckloads of National Guardsmen had 
arrived and troopers and policemen were again crouched every- 
where looking for a sniper. The Director of Police remained 
at the scene for three hours, and the only shot fired was the 
one by the Guardsman. 

Nevertheless, at six o'clock that evening two columns of 
National Guardsmen and state troopers were directing mass fire 
at the Hayes Housing Project in response to what they believed 
iVere snipers. . . . 

DETROIT 

• . . A spirit of carefree nihilism was taking hold. To riot 
and destroy appeared more and more to become ends in them- 
selves. Late Sunday afternoon it appeared to one observer that 
the young people were "dancing amidst the flames." 

A Negro plainclothes officer was standing at an intersection 
when a man threw a Molotov cocktail into a business establish- 
ment at the corner. In the heat of the afternoon, fanned by the 
20 to 25 m.p.h. winds of both Sunday and Monday, the fire 
reached the home next door within minutes. As residents use- 
lessly sprayed the flames with garden hoses, the fire jumped 
from roof to roof of adjacent two- and three-story buildings. 
Within the hour the entire block was in flames. The ninth house 
in the burning row belonged to the arsonist who had thrown 
the Molotov cocktail. . . . 

* *     * 

• • . Employed as a private guard, 55-year-old Julius L. Dor- 
sey, a Negro, was standing in front of a market when accosted 
by two Negro men and a woman. They demanded he permit 
them to loot the market. He ignored them demands. They began 
to berate him. He asked a neighbor to call the police. As the 
argument grew more heated, Dorsey fired three shots from 
hispistol into the air. 

The police radio reported: "Looters, they have rifles." A patrol 
car driven by a police officer and carrying three National Guards- 
men arrived. As the looters fled, the law enforcement personnel 
opened fire. When the firing ceased, one person lay dead. 

He was Julius L. Dorsey . . . 

* *     * 

... As the riot alternately waxed and waned, one area of the 
ghetto remained insulated. On the northeast side the residents of 
some 150 square blocks inhabited by 21,000 persons had, in 
1966, banded together in the Positive Neighborhood Action Com- 

4 


mittee (PNAC). With professional help from the Institute of 
Urban Dynamics, they had organized block clubs and made 
plans for the improvement of the neighborhood. . . . 

When the riot broke out, the residents, through the block clubs, 
were able to organize quickly. Youngsters, agreeing to stay in the 
neighborhood, participated in detouring traffic. While many per- 
sons reportedly sympathized with the idea of a rebellion against 
the "system," only two small fires were set — one in an empty 
building. 

*     *     * 

. . . According to Lt. Gen. Throckmorton and Col. Boiling, 
the city, at this time, was saturated with fear. The National 
Guardsmen were afraid, the citizens were afraid, and the police 
were afraid. Numerous persons, the majority of them Negroes, 
were being injured by gunshots of undetermined origin. The gen- 
eral and his staff felt that the major task of the troops was to 
reduce the fear and restore an air of normalcy. 

In order to accomplish this, every effort was made to establish 
contact and rapport between the troops and the residents. The 
soldiers — 20 percent of whom were Negro — began helping to 
clean up the streets, collect garbage, and trace persons who had 
disappeared in the confusion. Residents in the neighborhoods re- 
sponded with soup and sandwiches for the troops. In areas where 
the National Guard tried to establish rapport with the citizens, 
there was a similar response. 

NEW BRUNSWICK 

• . . A short time later, elements of the crowd — an older and 
rougher one than the night before — appeared in front of the 
police station. The participants wanted to see the mayor. 

Mayor [Patricia] Sheehan went out onto the steps of the station. 
Using a bullhorn, she talked to the people and asked that she 
be given an opportunity to correct conditions. The crowd was 
boisterous. Some persons challenged the mayor. But, finally, the 
opinion, "She's new! Give her a chance!" prevailed. 

A demand was issued by people in the crowd that all persons 
arrested the previous night be released. Told that this already 
had been done, the people were suspicious. They asked to be 
allowed to inspect the jail cells. 

It was agreed to permit representatives of the people to look 
in the cells to satisfy themselves that everyone had been released. 

The crowd dispersed. The New Brunswick riot had failed to 
materialize. 

Chapter 2 — Patterns of Disorder 

The "typical" riot did not take place. The disorders of 1967 
were unusual, irregular, complex and unpredictable social 
processes. Like most human events, they did not unfold in 
an orderly sequence. However, an analysis of our survey 
information leads to some conclusions about the riot process. 

In general: 

5 


) 

• The civil disorders of 1967 involved Negroes acting against local 
symbols of white American society, authority and property in 
Negro neighborhoods — rather than against white persons. 

• Of 164 disorders reported during the first nine months of 1967, 
eight (5 percent) were major in terms of violence and damage; 
33 (20 percent) were serious but not major; 123 (75 percent) 
were minor and undoubtedly would not have received national 
attention as riots had the nation not been sensitized by the 
more serious outbreaks. 

• In the 75 disorders studied by a Senate subcommittee, 83 deaths 
were reported. Eighty-two percent of the deaths and more than 
half the injuries occurred in Newark and Detroit. About 10 per- 
cent of the dead and 38 percent of the injured were public em- 
ployees, primarily law officers and firemen. The overwhelming 
majority of the persons killed or injured in all the disorders were 
Negro civilians. 

• Initial damage estimates were greatly exaggerated. In Detroit, 
newspaper damage estimates at first ranged from $200 million to 
$500 million; the highest recent estimate is $45 million. In 
Newark, early estimates ranged from $15 to $25 million. A 
month later damage was estimated at $10.2 million, 80 percent 
in inventory losses. 

In the 24 disorders in 23 cities which we surveyed: 

• The final incident before the outbreak of disorder, and the initial 
violence itself, generally took place in the evening or at night at 
a place in which it was normal for many people to be on the 
streets. 

• Violence usually occurred almost immediately following the oc- 
currence of the final precipitating incident, and then escalated 
rapidly. With but few exceptions, violence subsided during the 
day, and flared rapidly again at night. The night-day cycles con- 
tinued through the early period of the major disorders. 

• Disorder generally began with rock and bottle throwing and win- 
dow breaking. Once store windows were broken, looting usually 
followed. 

• Disorder did not erupt as a result of a single "triggering" or 
"precipitating" incident. Instead, it was generated out of an in- 
creasingly disturbed social atmosphere, in which typically a series 
of tension-heightening incidents over a period of weeks or months 
became linked in the minds of many in the Negro community 
with a reservoir of underlying grievances. At some point in the 
mounting tension, a further incident — in itself often routine or 
trivial — became the breaking point and the tension spilled over 
into violence. 

• "Prior" incidents, which increased tensions and ultimately led to 
violence, were police actions in almost half the cases; police ac- 
tions were "final" incidents before the outbreak of violence in 
12 of the 24 surveyed disorders. 

• No particular control tactic was successful in every situation. The 
varied effectiveness of control techniques emphasizes the need 
for advance training, planning, adequate intelligence systems, and 
knowledge of the ghetto community. 

6 


• Negotiations between Negroes — including young militants as well 
as older Negro leaders — and white officials concerning "terms of 
peace" occurred during virtually all the disorders surveyed. In 
many cases, these negotiations involved discussion of underlying 
grievances as well as the handling of the disorder by control 
authorities. 

• The typical rioter was a teenager or young adult, a lifelong resi- 
dent of the city in which he rioted, a high school dropout; he 
was, nevertheless, somewhat better educated than his nonrioting 
Negro neighbor, and was usually underemployed or employed in a 
menial job. He was proud of his race, extremely hostile to both 
whites and middle-class Negroes and, although informed about 
politics, highly distrustful of the political system. 

A Detroit survey revealed that approximately 1 1 percent of 
the total residents of two riot areas admitted participation in 
the rioting, 20 to 25 percent identified themselves as "by- 
standers," over 16 percent identified themselves as "counter- 
rioters" who urged rioters to "cool it," and the remaining 48 
to 53 percent said they were at home or elsewhere and did not 
participate. In a survey of Negro males between the ages of 
15 and 35 residing in the disturbance area in Newark, about 
45 percent identified themselves as rioters, and about 55 per- 
cent as "noninvolved." 

• Most rioters were young Negro males. Nearly 53 percent of 
arrestees were between 15 and 24 years of age; nearly 81 per- 
cent between 15 and 35. 

• In Detroit and Newark about 74 percent of the rioters were 
brought up in the North. In contrast, of the noninvolved, 36 
percent in Detroit and 52 percent in Newark were brought up 
in the North. 

• What the rioters appeared to be seeking was fuller participa- 
tion in the social order and the material benefits enjoyed by the 
majority of American citizens. Rather than rejecting the Ameri- 
can system, they were anxious to obtain a place for themselves 
in it. 

• Numerous Negro counter-rioters walked the streets urging rioters 
to "cool it." The typical counter-rioter was better educated and 
had higher income than either the rioter or the noninvolved. 

• The proportion of Negroes in local government was substantially 
smaller than the Negro proportion of population. Only three of 
the 20 cities studied had more than one Negro legislator; none 
had ever had a Negro mayor or city manager. In only four 
cities did Negroes hold other important policy-making positions 
or serve as heads of municipal departments. 

• Although almost all cities had some sort of formal grievance 
mechanism for handling citizen complaints, this typically was 
regarded by Negroes as ineffective and was generally ignored. 

• Although specific grievances varied from city to city, at least 
12 deeply held grievances can be identified and ranked into three 
levels of relative intensity: 

7 


First Level of Intensity 

1. Police practices 

2. Unemployment and underemployment 

3. Inadequate housing 

Second Level of Intensity 

4. Inadequate education 

5. Poor recreation facilities and programs 

6. Ineffectiveness  of  the  political  structure  and  grievance 
mechanisms 

Third Level of Intensity 

7. Disrespectful white attitudes 

8. Discriminatory administration of justice 

9. Inadequacy of federal programs 

10. Inadequacy of municipal services 

11. Discriminatory consumer and credit practices 

12. Inadequate welfare programs 

• The results of a three-city survey of various federal programs — 
manpower, education, housing, welfare and community action — 
indicate that, despite substantial expenditures, the number of 
persons assisted constituted only a fraction of those in need. 

The background of disorder is often as complex and difficult 
to analyze as the disorder itself. But we find that certain general 
conclusions can be drawn: 

• Social and economic conditions in the riot cities constituted a 
clear pattern of severe disadvantage for Negroes compared with 
whites, whether the Negroes lived in the area where the riot 
took place or outside it. Negroes had completed fewer years 
of education and fewer had attended high school. Negroes were 
twice as likely to be unemployed and three times as likely to be 
in unskilled and service jobs. Negroes averaged 70 percent of 
the income earned by whites and were more than twice as 
likely to be living in poverty. Although housing cost Negroes 
relatively more, they had worse housing — three times as likely 
to be overcrowded and substandard. When compared to white 
suburbs, the relative disadvantage is even more pronounced. 

A study of the aftermath of disorder leads to disturbing 
conclusions. We find that, despite the institution of some post- 
riot programs: 

• Little basic change in the conditions underlying the outbreak of 
disorder has taken place. Actions to ameliorate Negro grievances 
have been limited and sporadic; with but few exceptions, they 
have not significantly reduced tensions. 

• In several cities, the principal official response has been to train 
and equip the police with more sophisticated weapons. 

• In several cities, increasing polarization is evident, with con- 
tinuing breakdown of inter-racial communication, and growth 
of white segregationist or black separatist groups.

Chapter 3 — Organized Activity 

The President directed the Commission to investigate "to 
what extent, if any, there has been planning or organization 
in any of the riots." 

To carry out this part of the President's charge, the Com- 
mission established a special investigative staff supplementing 
the field teams that made the general examination of the riots 
in 23 cities. The unit examined data collected by federal 
agencies and congressional committees, including thousands 
of documents supplied by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
gathered and evaluated information from local and state law 
enforcement agencies and officials, and conducted its own field 
investigation in selected cities. 

On the basis of all the information collected, the Commission 
concludes that: 

The urban disorders of the summer of 1967 were not caused 
by, nor were they the consequence of, any organized plan or 
"conspiracy." 

Specifically, the Commission has found no evidence that all 
or any of the disorders or the incidents that led to them were 
planned or directed by any organization or group, interna- 
tional, national or local. 

Militant organizations, local and national, and individual 
agitators, who repeatedly forecast and called for violence, were 
active in the spring and summer of 1967. We believe that they 
sought to encourage violence, and that they helped to create 
an atmosphere that contributed to the outbreak of disorder. 

We recognize that the continuation of disorders and the 
polarization of the races would provide fertile ground for 
organized exploitation in the future. 

Investigations of organized activity are continuing at all 
levels of government, including committees of Congress. These 
investigations relate not only to the disorders of 1967 but also 
to the actions of groups and individuals, particularly in schools 
and colleges, during this last fall and winter. The Commission 
has cooperated in these investigations. They should continue. 

Part II — Why Did It Happen? 

Chapter 4 — The Basic Causes 

In addressing the question "Why did it happen?" we shift 
our focus from the local to the national scene, from the par- 

9 


ticular events of the summer of 1967 to the factors within 
the society at large that created a mood of violence among 
many urban Negroes. 

These factors are complex and interacting; they vary sig- 
nificantly in their effect from city to city and from year to 
year; and the consequences of one disorder, generating new 
grievances and new demands, become the causes of the next. 
Thus was created the "thicket of tension, conflicting evidence 
and extreme opinions" cited by the President. 

Despite these complexities, certain fundamental matters are 
clear. Of these, the most fundamental is the racial attitude 
and behavior of white Americans toward black Americans. 

Race prejudice has shaped our history decisively; it now 
threatens to affect our future. 

White racism is essentially responsible for the explosive 
mixture which has been accumulating in our cities since the 
end of World War II. Among the ingredients of this mixture 
are: 

• Pervasive discrimination and segregation in employment, educa- 
tion and housing, which have resulted in the continuing exclu- 
sion of great numbers of Negroes from the benefits of economic 
progress. 

• Black in-migration and white exodus, which have produced the 
massive and growing concentrations of impoverished Negroes 
in our major cities, creating a growing crisis of deteriorating 
facilities and services and unmet human needs. 

• The black ghettos where segregation and poverty converge on 
the young to destroy opportunity and enforce failure. Crime, 
drug addiction, dependency on welfare, and bitterness and resent- 
ment against society in general and white society in particular 
are the result. 

At the same time, most whites and some Negroes outside 
the ghetto have prospered to a degree unparalleled in the his- 
tory of civilization. Through television and other media, this 
affluence has been flaunted before the eyes of the Negro poor 
and the jobless ghetto youth. 

Yet these facts alone cannot be said to have caused the 
disorders. Recently, other powerful ingredients have begun 
to catalyze the mixture: 

• Frustrated hopes are the residue of the unfulfilled expectations 
aroused by the great judicial and legislative victories of the Civil 
Rights Movement and the dramatic struggle for equal rights in 
the South. 

• A climate that tends toward approval and encouragement of 
violence as a form of protest has been created by white terrorism 
directed against nonviolent protest; by the open defiance of law 
and federal authority by state and local officials resisting desegre- 

10 


gation; and by some protest groups engaging in civil disobedience 
who turn their backs on nonviolence, go beyond the constitu- 
tionally protected rights of petition and free assembly, and 
resort to violence to attempt to compel alteration of laws and 
policies with which they disagree. 

• The frustrations of powerlessness have led some Negroes to the 
conviction that there is no effective alternative to violence as a 
means of achieving redress of grievances, and of "moving the 
system." These frustrations are reflected in alienation and hos- 
tility toward the institutions of law and government and the 
white society which controls them, and in the reach toward 
racial consciousness and solidarity reflected in the slogan "Black 
Power." 

• A new mood has sprung up among Negroes, particularly among 
the young, in which self-esteem and enhanced racial pride are 
replacing apathy and submission to "the system." 

• The police are not merely a "spark" factor. To some Negroes 
police have come to symbolize white power, white racism and 
white repression. And the fact is that many police do reflect 
and express these white attitudes. The atmosphere of hostility 
and cynicism is reinforced by a widespread belief among Negroes 
in the existence of police brutality and in a "double standard" 
of justice and protection — one for Negroes and one for whites, 

*     *     * 

To this point, we have attempted to identify the prime com- 
ponents of the "explosive mixture." In the chapters that follow 
we seek to analyze them in the perspective of history. Their 
meaning, however, is clear: 

In the summer of 1967, we have seen in our cities a chain 
reaction of racial violence. If we are heedless, none of us 
shall escape the consequences. 

Chapter 5 — Rejection and Protest: An Historical Sketch 

The causes of recent racial disorders are embedded in a 
tangle of issues and circumstances — social, economic, political 
and psychological — which arise out of the historic pattern of 
Negro-white relations in America. 

In this chapter we trace the pattern, identify the recurrent 
themes of Negro protest and, most importantly, provide a 
perspective on the protest activities of the present era. 

We describe the Negro's experience in America and the 
development of slavery as an institution. We show his per- 
sistent striving for equality in the face of rigidly maintained 
social, economic and educational barriers, and repeated mob 
violence. We portray the ebb and flow of the doctrinal tides — 
accommodation, separatism, and self-help — and their relation- 
ship to the current theme of Black Power. We conclude: 

The Black Power advocates of today consciously feel that they 
are the most militant group in the Negro protest movement. Yet 

11 


they have retreated from a direct confrontation with American 
society on the issue of integration and, by preaching separatism, 
unconsciously function as an accommodation to white racism. 
Much of their economic program, as well as their interest in Ne- 
gro history, self-help, racial solidarity and separation, is reminis- 
cent of Booker T. Washington. The rhetoric is different, but the 
ideas are remarkably similar. 

Chapter 6 — The Formation Of the Racial Ghettos1 

Throughout the 20th century the Negro population of the 
United States has been moving steadily from rural areas to 
urban and from South to North and West. In 1910, 91 percent 
of the nation's 9.8 million Negroes lived in the South and 
only 27 percent of American Negroes lived in cities of 2,500 
persons or more. Between 1910 and 1966 the total Negro 
population more than doubled, reaching 21.5 million, and 
the number living in metropolitan areas rose more than five- 
fold (from 2.6 million to 14.8 million). The number outside 
the South rose eleven-fold  (from 880,000 to 9.7 million). 

Negro migration from the South has resulted from the 
expectation of thousands of new and highly paid jobs for 
unskilled workers in the North and the shift to mechanized 
farming in the South. However, the Negro migration is small 
when compared to earlier waves of European immigrants. 
Even between 1960 and 1966, there were 1.8 million immi- 
grants from abroad compared to the 613,000 Negroes who 
arrived in the North and West from the South. 

As a result of the growing number of Negroes in urban 
areas, natural increase has replaced migration as the primary 
source of Negro population increase in the cities. Nevertheless, 
Negro migration from the South will continue unless economic 
conditions there change dramatically. 

Basic data concerning Negro urbanization trends indicate 
that: 

• Almost all Negro population growth (98 percent from 1950 to 
1966) is occurring within metropolitan areas, primarily within 
central cities.2 

• The vast majority of white population growth (78 percent from 
1960 to 1966) is occurring in suburban portions of metropolitan 
areas. Since 1960, white central-city population has declined by 
1.3 million. 

1The term "ghetto" as used in this report refers to an area within a city 
characterized by poverty and acute social disorganization, and inhabited by 
members of a racial or ethnic group under conditions of involuntary segrega- 
tion. 

8 A "central city" is the largest city of a standard metropolitan statistical 
area, that is, a metropolitan area containing at least one city of 50,000 or more 
inhabitants. 

12 


• As a result, central cities are becoming more heavily Negro while 
the suburban fringes around them remain almost entirely white. 

• The twelve largest central cities now contain over two-thirds of 
the Negro population outside the South, and one-third of the 
Negro total in the United States. 

Within the cities, Negroes have been excluded from white 
residential areas through discriminatory practices. Just as sig- 
nificant is the withdrawal of white families from, or their 
refusal to enter, neighborhoods where Negroes are moving 
or already residing. About 20 percent of the urban population 
of the United States changes residence every year. The refusal 
of whites to move into "changing" areas when vacancies occur 
means that most vacancies eventually are occupied by Negroes. 

The result, according to a recent study, is that in 1960 
the average segregation index for 207 of the largest United 
States cities was 86.2. In other words, to create an unsegre- 
gated population distribution, an average of over 86 percent 
of all Negroes would have to change their place of residence 
within the city. 

Chapter 7 — Unemployment, Family Structure, and Social 
Disorganization 

Although there have been gains in Negro income nationally, 
and a decline in the number of Negroes below the "poverty 
level," the condition of Negroes in the central city remains in 
a state of crisis. Between 2 and 2.5 million Negroes — 16 to 
20 percent of the total Negro population of all central cities — 
live in squalor and deprivation in ghetto neighborhoods. 

Employment is a key problem. It not only controls the 
present for the Negro American but, in a most profound way, 
it is creating the future as well. Yet, despite continuing eco- 
nomic growth and declining national unemployment rates, the 
unemployment rate for Negroes in 1967 was more than double 
that for whites. 

Equally important is the undesirable nature of many jobs 
open to Negroes and other minorities. Negro men are more 
than three times as likely as white men to be in low-paying, 
unskilled or service jobs. This concentration of male Negro 
employment at the lowest end of the occupational scale is 
the single most important cause of poverty among Negroes. 

In one study of low-income neighborhoods, the "subemploy- 
ment rate," including both unemployment and underemploy- 
ment, was about 33 percent, or 8.8 times greater than the 
overall unemployment rate for all United States workers. 

Employment problems, aggravated by the constant arrival 
of new unemployed migrants, many of them from depressed 

13 


rural areas, create persistent poverty in the ghetto. In 1966, 
about 11.9 percent of the nation's whites and 40.6 percent of 
its nonwhites were below the "poverty level" defined by the 
Social Security Administration (in 1966, $3,335 per year for 
an urban family of four). Over 40 percent of the nonwhites 
below the poverty level live in the central cities. 

Employment problems have drastic social impact in the 
ghetto. Men who are chronically unemployed or employed in 
the lowest status jobs are often unable or unwilling to remain 
with their families. The handicap imposed on children grow- 
ing up without fathers in an atmosphere of poverty and de- 
privation is increased as mothers are forced to work to provide 
support. 

The culture of poverty that results from unemployment and 
family breakup generates a system of ruthless, exploitative 
relationships within the ghetto. Prostitution, dope addiction, 
and crime create an environmental "jungle" characterized by 
personal insecurity and tension. Children growing up under 
such conditions ar£ likely participants in civil disorder. 

Chapter 8 — Conditions of Life In the Racial Ghetto 

A striking difference in environment from that of white, 
middle-class Americans profoundly influences the lives of resi- 
dents of the ghetto. 

Crime rates, consistently higher than in other areas, create 
a pronounced sense of insecurity. For example, in one city 
one low-income Negro district had 35 times as many serious 
crimes against persons as a high-income white district. Unless 
drastic steps are taken, the crime problems in poverty areas 
are likely to continue to multiply as the growing youth and 
rapid urbanization of the population outstrip police resources. 

Poor health and sanitation conditions in the ghetto result 
in higher mortality rates, a higher incidence of major diseases, 
and lower availability and utilization of medical services. The 
infant mortality rate for nonwhite babies under the age of one 
month is 58 percent higher than for whites; for one to 12 
months it is almost three times as high. The level of sanitation 
in the ghetto is far below that in high income areas. Garbage 
collection is often inadequate. Of an estimated 14,000 cases 
of rat bite in the United States in 1965, most were in ghetto 
neighborhoods. 

Ghetto residents believe they are exploited by local mer- 
chants; and evidence substantiates some of these beliefs. A 
study conducted in one city by the Federal Trade Commission 
showed that higher prices were charged for goods sold in 
ghetto stores than in other areas. 

14 


Lack of knowledge regarding credit purchasing creates spe- 
cial pitfalls for the disadvantaged. In many states garnishment 
practices compound these difficulties by allowing creditors to 
deprive individuals of their wages without hearing or trial. 

Chapter 9 — Comparing the Immigrant and Negro Experience 

In this chapter, we address ourselves to a fundamental ques- 
tion that many white Americans are asking: why have so many 
Negroes, unlike the European immigrants, been unable to 
escape from the ghetto and from poverty. We believe the fol- 
lowing factors play a part: 

• The Maturing Economy: When the European immigrants arrived, 
they gained an economic foothold by providing the unskilled labor 
needed by industry. Unlike the immigrant, the Negro migrant 
found little opportunity in the city. The economy, by then ma- 
tured, had little use for the unskilled labor he had to offer. 

• The Disability of Race: The structure of discrimination has strin- 
gently narrowed opportunities for the Negro and restricted his 
prospects. European immigrants suffered from discrimination, but 
never so pervasively. 

• Entry into the Political System: The immigrants usually settled 
in rapidly growing cities with powerful and expanding political 
machines, which traded economic advantages for political sup- 
port. Ward-level grievance machinery, as well as personal repre- 
sentation, enabled the immigrant to make his voice heard and 
his power felt. 

By the time the Negro arrived, these political machines were 
no longer so powerful or so well equipped to provide jobs or 
other favors, and in many cases were unwilling to share their in- 
fluence with Negroes. 

• Cultural Factors: Coming from societies with a low standard of 
living and at a time when job aspirations were low, the immigrants 
sensed little deprivation in being forced to take the less desirable 
and poorer-paying jobs. Their large and cohesive families con- 
tributed to total income. Their vision of the future — one that 
led to a life outside of the ghetto — provided the incentive neces- 
sary to endure the present. 

Although Negro men worked as hard as the immigrants, they 
were unable to support their families. The entrepreneurial op- 
portunities had vanished. As a result of slavery and long periods 
of unemployment, the Negro family structure had become ma- 
triarchal; the males played a secondary and marginal family role 
— one which offered little compensation for their hard and un- 
rewarding labor. Above all, segregation denied Negroes access to 
good jobs and the opportunity to leave the ghetto. For them, the 
future seemed to lead only to a dead end. 

Today, whites tend to exaggerate how well and quickly they 
escaped from poverty. The fact is that immigrants who came 
from rural backgrounds, as many Negroes do, are only now, 

15 


after three generations, finally beginning to move into the 
middle class. 

By contrast, Negroes began concentrating in the city less 
than two generations ago, and under much less favorable con- 
ditions. Although some Negroes have escaped poverty, few 
have been able to escape the urban ghetto. 

Part III — What Can Be Done? 
Chapter 10 — The Community Response 

Our investigation of the 1967 riot cities establishes that 
virtually every major episode of violence was foreshadowed 
by an accumulation of unresolved grievances and by wide- 
spread dissatisfaction among Negroes with the unwillingness 
or inability of local government to respond. 

Overcoming these conditions is essential for community 
support of law enforcement and civil order. City governments 
need new and more vital channels of communication to the 
residents of the ghetto; they need to improve their capacity 
to respond effectively to community needs before they become 
community grievances; and they need to provide opportunity 
for meaningful involvement of ghetto residents in shaping 
policies and programs which affect the community. 

The Commission recommends that local governments: 

• Develop Neighborhood Action Task Forces as joint community- 
government efforts through which more effective communication 
can be achieved, and the delivery of city services to ghetto resi- 
dents improved. 

• Establish comprehensive grievance-response mechanisms in order 
to bring all public agencies under public scrutiny. 

• Bring the institutions of local government closer to the people 
they serve by establishing neighborhood outlets for local, state 
and federal administrative and public service agencies. 

• Expand opportunities for ghetto residents to participate in the 
formulation of public policy and the implementation of programs 
affecting them through improved political representation, creation 
of institutional channels for community action, expansion of 
legal services, and legislative hearings on ghetto problems. 

In this effort, city governments will require state and federal 
support. 

The Commission recommends: 

• State and federal financial assistance for mayors and city councils 
to support the research, consultants, staff and other resources 
needed to respond effectively to federal program initiatives. 

16 


• State cooperation in providing municipalities with the jurisdic- 
tional tools needed to deal with their problems; a fuller measure 
of financial aid to urban areas; and the focusing of the interests 
of suburban communities on the physical, social and cultural 
environment of the central city. 

Chapter 11 — Police and the Community 

The abrasive relationship between the police and the minor- 
ity communities has been a major — and explosive — source of 
grievance, tension and disorder. The blame must be shared 
by the total society. 

The police are faced with demands for increased protection 
and service in the ghetto. Yet the aggressive patrol practices 
thought necessary to meet these demands themselves create 
tension and hostility. The resulting grievances have been 
further aggravated by the lack of effective mechanisms for 
handling complaints against the police. Special programs for 
bettering police-community relations have been instituted, but 
these alone are not enough. Police administrators, with the 
guidance of public officials, and the support of the entire com- 
munity, must take vigorous action to improve law enforce- 
ment and to decrease the potential for disorder. 

The Commission recommends that city government and 
police authorities: 

• Review police operations in the ghetto to ensure proper conduct 
by police officers, and eliminate abrasive practices. 

• Provide more adequate police protection to ghetto residents to 
eliminate their high sense of insecurity, and the belief in the 
existence of a dual standard of law enforcement. 

• Establish fair and effective mechanisms for the redress of 
grievances against the police, and other municipal employees. 

• Develop and adopt policy guidelines to assist officers in making 
critical decisions in areas where police conduct can create 
tension. 

• Develop and use innovative programs to ensure widespread 
community support for law enforcement. 

• Recruit more Negroes into the regular police force, and review 
promotion policies to ensure fair promotion for Negro officers. 

• Establish a "Community Service Officer" program to attract 
ghetto youths between the ages of 17 and 21 to police work. 
These junior officers would perform duties in ghetto neighbor- 
hoods, but would not have full police authority. The federal 
government should provide support equal to 90 percent of the 
costs of employing CSOs on the basis of one for every ten 
regular officers. 

Chapter 12 — Control of Disorder 

Preserving civil peace is the first responsibility of govern- 
ment.  Unless the rule of law prevails, our society will lack 

17 


not only order but also the environment essential to social and 
economic progress. 

The maintenance of civil order cannot be left to the police 
alone. The police need guidance, as well as support, from 
mayors and other public officials. It is the responsibility of 
public officials to determine proper police policies, support 
adequate police standards for personnel and performance, and 
participate in planning for the control of disorders. 

To maintain control of incidents which could lead to dis- 
orders, the Commission recommends that local officials: 


• Assign seasoned, well-trained policemen and supervisory officers 
to patrol ghetto areas, and to respond to disturbances. 

• Develop plans which will quickly muster maximum police man- 
power and highly qualified senior commanders at the outbreak 
of disorders. 

• Provide special training in the prevention of disorders, and pre- 
pare police for riot control and for operation in units, with 
adequate command and control and field communication for 
proper discipline and effectiveness. 

• Develop guidelines governing the use of control equipment and 
provide alternatives to the use of lethal weapons. Federal sup- 
port for research in this area is needed. 

• Establish an intelligence system to provide police and other 
public officials with reliable information that may help to pre- 
vent the outbreak of a disorder and to institute effective control 
measures in the event a riot erupts. 

• Develop continuing contacts with ghetto residents to make use 
of the forces for order which exist within the community. 

• Establish machinery for neutralizing rumors, and enabling Negro 
leaders and residents to obtain the facts. Create special rumor 
details to collect, evaluate, and dispel rumors that may lead to 
a civil disorder. 


The Commission believes there is a grave danger that some 
communities may resort to the indiscriminate and excessive 
use of force. The harmful effects of overreaction are incalcul- 
able. The Commission condemns moves to equip police depart- 
ments with mass destruction weapons, such as automatic rifles, 
machine guns and tanks. Weapons which are designed to de- 
stroy, not to control, have no place in densely populated urban 
communities. 

The Commission recommends that the federal government 
share in the financing of programs for improvement of police 
forces, both in their normal law enforcement activities as well 
as in their response to civil disorders. 

To assist government authorities in planning their response 
to civil disorder, this report contains a Supplement on Control 

18 


of Disorder. It deals with specific problems encountered during 
riot-control operations, and includes: 


• Assessment of the present capabilities of police, National Guard 
and Army forces to control major riots, and recommendations 
for improvement; 

• Recommended means by which the control operations of those 
forces may be coordinated with the response of other agencies, 
such as fire departments, and with the community at large; 

• Recommendations for review and revision of federal, state and 
local laws needed to provide the framework for control efforts 
and for the call-up and interrelated action of public safety forces. 

Chapter 13 — The Administration of Justice Under Emergency 
Conditions 


In many of the cities which experienced disorders last sum- 
mer, there were recurring breakdowns in the mechanisms for 
processing, prosecuting and protecting arrested persons. These 
resulted mainly from long-standing structural deficiencies in 
criminal court systems, and from the failure of communities 
to anticipate and plan for the emergency demands of civil 
disorders. 

In part, because of this, there were few successful prosecu- 
tions for serious crimes committed during the riots. In those 
cities where mass arrests occurred many arrestees were de- 
prived of basic legal rights. 

The Commission recommends that the cities and states: 


• Undertake reform of the lower courts so as to improve the 
quality of justice rendered under normal conditions. 

• Plan comprehensive measures by which the criminal justice sys- 
tem may be supplemented during civil disorders so that its 
deliberative functions are protected, and the quality of justice 
is maintained. 


Such emergency plans require broad community participa- 
tion and dedicated leadership by the bench and bar. They 
should include: 


• Laws sufficient to deter and punish riot conduct. 

• Additional judges, bail and probation officers, and clerical staff. 

• Arrangements for volunteer lawyers to help prosecutors and to 
represent riot defendants at every stage of proceedings. 

• Policies to ensure proper and individual bail, arraignment, pre- 
trial, trial and sentencing proceedings. 

• Adequate emergency processing and detention f acilities. 

19 


Chapter 14 — Damages: Repair and Compensation 

The Commission recommends that the federal government: 

• Amend the Federal Disaster Act — which now applies only to nat- 
ural disasters — to permit federal emergency food and medical 
assistance to cities during major civil disorders, and provide 
long-term economic assistance afterwards. 

• With the cooperation of the states, create incentives for the private 
insurance industry to provide more adequate property-insurance 
coverage in inner-city areas. 

The Commission endorses the report of the National Ad- 
visory Panel on Insurance in Riot- Affected Areas: "Meeting 
the Insurance Crisis of our Cities." 

Chapter 15 — The News Media and the Disorders 

In his charge to the Commission, the President asked: 
"What effect do the mass media have on the riots?" 

The Commission determined that the answer to the Presi- 
dent's question did not lie solely in the performance of the 
press and broadcasters in reporting the riots. Our analysis had 
to consider also the overall treatment by the media of the 
Negro ghettos, community relations, racial attitudes, and pov- 
erty— day by day and month by month, year in and year out 

A wide range of interviews with government officials, law 
enforcement authorities, media personnel and other citizens, 
including ghetto residents, as well as a quantitative analysis 
of riot coverage and a special conference with industry rep- 
resentatives, leads us to conclude that: 

• Despite instances of sensationalism, inaccuracy and distortion, 
newspapers, radio and television tried on the whole to give a 
balanced, factual account of the 1967 disorders. 

• Elements of the news media failed to portray accurately the scale 
and character of the violence that occurred last summer. The 
overall effect was, we believe, an exaggeration of both mood and 
event. 

• Important segments of the media failed to report adequately on 
the causes and consequences of civil disorders and on the under- 
lying problems of race relations. They have not communicated 
to the majority of their audience — which is white — a sense of the 
degradation, misery and hopelessness of life in the ghetto. 

These failings must be corrected, and the improvement must 
come from within the industry. Freedom of the press is not 
the issue. Any effort to impose governmental restrictions 
would be inconsistent with fundamental constitutional precepts. 

20 


We have seen evidence that the news media are becoming 
aware of and concerned about their performance in this field. 
As that concern grows, coverage will improve. But much 
more must be done, and it must be done soon. 

The Commission recommends that the media: 

• Expand coverage of the Negro community and of race problems 
through permanent assignment of reporters familiar with urban 
and racial affairs, and through establishment of more and better 
links with the Negro community. 

• Integrate Negroes and Negro activities into all aspects of cov- 
erage and content, including newspaper articles and television 
programming. The news media must publish newspapers and 
produce programs that recognize the existence and activities of 
Negroes as a group within title community and as a part of the 
larger community. 

• Recruit more Negroes into journalism and broadcasting and 
promote those who are qualified to positions of significant re- 
sponsibility. Recruitment should begin in high schools and con- 
tinue through college; where necessary, aid for training should 
be provided. 

• Improve coordination with police in reporting riot news through 
advance planning, and cooperate with the police in the designa- 
tion of police information officers, establishment of information 
centers, and development of mutually acceptable guidelines for 
riot reporting and the conduct of media personnel. 

• Accelerate efforts to ensure accurate and responsible reporting of 
riot and racial news, through adoption by all news gathering 
organizations of stringent internal staff guidelines. 

• Cooperate in the establishment of a privately organized and 
funded Institute of Urban Communications to train and educate 
journalists in urban affairs, recruit and train more Negro jour- 
nalists, develop methods for improving police-press relations, re- 
view coverage of riots and racial issues, and support continuing 
research in the urban field. 

Chapter 16 — The Future of the Cities 

By 1985, the Negro population in central cities is expected 
to increase by 68 percent to approximately 20.3 million. 
Coupled with the continued exodus of white families to the 
suburbs, this growth will produce majority Negro populations 
in many of the nation's largest cities. 

The future of these cities, and of their burgeoning Negro 
populations, is grim. Most new employment opportunities are 
being created in suburbs and outlying areas. This trend will 
continue unless important changes in public policy are made. 

In prospect, therefore, is further deterioration of already 
inadequate municipal tax bases in the face of increasing de- 
mands for public services, and continuing unemployment and 
poverty among the urban Negro population: 

21 


Three choices are open to the nation: 

• We can maintain present policies, continuing both the proportion 
of the nation's resources now allocated to programs for the un- 
employed and the disadvantaged, and the inadequate and failing 
effort to achieve an integrated society. 

• We can adopt a policy of "enrichment" aimed at improving dra- 
matically the quality of ghetto life while abandoning integration 
as a goal. * 

• We can pursue integration by combining ghetto "enrichment" 
with policies which will encourage Negro movement out of cen- 
tral city areas. 

The first choice, continuance of present policies, has omi- 
nous consequences for our society. The share of the nation's 
resources now allocated to programs for the disadvantaged is 
insufficient to arrest the deterioration of life in central city 
ghettos. Under such conditions, a rising proportion of Negroes 
may come to see in the deprivation and segregation they 
experience, a justification for violent protest, or for extending 
support to now isolated extremists who advocate civil disrup- 
tion. Large-scale and continuing violence could result, followed 
by white retaliation, and, ultimately, the separation of the two 
communities in a garrison state. 

Even if violence does not occur, the consequences are un- 
acceptable. Development of a racially integrated society, 
extraordinarily difficult today, will be virtually impossible when 
the present black central city population of 12.1 million has 
grown to almost 21 million. 

To continue present policies is to make permanent the divi- 
sion of our country into two societies; one, largely Negro and 
poor, located in the central cities; the other, predominantly 
white and affluent, located in the suburbs and in outlying areas. 

The second choice, ghetto enrichment coupled with aban- 
donment of integration, is also unacceptable. It is another way 
of choosing a permanently divided country. Moreover, equality 
cannot be achieved under conditions of nearly complete sepa- 
ration. In a country where the economy, and particularly the 
resources of employment, are predominantly white, a policy 
of separation can only relegate Negroes to a permanently in- 
ferior economic status. 

We believe that the only possible choice for America is the 
third — a policy which combines ghetto enrichment with pro- 
grams designed to encourage integration of substantial num- 
bers of Negroes into the society outside the ghetto. 

Enrichment must be an important adjunct to integration, 
for no matter how ambitious or energetic the program, few 
Negroes now living in central cities can be quickly integrated. 

22 


In the meantime, large-scale improvement in the quality of 
ghetto life is essential. 

But this can be no more than an interim strategy. Programs 
must be developed which will permit substantial Negro move- 
ment out of the ghettos. The primary goal must be a single 
society, in which every citizen will be free to live and work 
according to his capabilities and desires, not his color. 

Chapter 17 — Recommendations For National Action 

INTRODUCTION 

No American — white or black — can escape the conse- 
quences of the continuing social and economic decay of our 
major cities. 

Only a commitment to national action on an unprecedented 
scale can shape a future compatible with the historic ideals of 
American society. 

The great productivity of our economy, and a federal reve- 
nue system which is highly responsive to economic growth, can 
provide the resources. 

The major need is to generate new will — the will to tax 
ourselves to the extent necessary to meet the vital needs of 
the nation. 

We have set forth goals and proposed strategies to reach 
those goals. We discuss and recommend programs not to com- 
mit each of us to specific parts of such programs but to 
illustrate the type and dimension of action needed. 

The major goal is the creation of a true union — a single 
society and a single American identity. Toward that goal, we 
propose the following objectives for national action: 

• Opening up opportunities to those who are restricted by racial 
segregation and discrimination, and eliminating all barriers to 
their choice of jobs, education and housing. 

• Removing the frustration of powerlessness among the disadvan- 
taged by providing the means for them to deal with the prob- 
lems that affect their own lives and by increasing the capacity 
of our public and private institutions to respond to these 
problems. 

• Increasing communication across racial lines to destroy stereo- 
types, to halt polarization, end distrust and hostility, and create 
common ground for efforts toward public order and social justice. 

We propose these aims to fulfill our pledge of equality and 
to meet the fundamental needs of a democratic and civilized 
society — domestic peace and social justice. 

23 


EMPLOYMENT 

Pervasive unemployment and underemployment are the most 
persistent and serious grievances in minority areas. They are 
inextricably linked to the problem of civil disorder. 

Despite growing federal expenditures for manpower devel- 
opment and training programs, and sustained general economic 
prosperity and increasing demands for skilled workers, about 
two million — white and nonwhite — are permanently unem- 
ployed. About ten million are underemployed, of whom 6.5 
million work full time for wages below the poverty line. 

The 500,000 "hard-core" unemployed in the central cities 
who lack a basic education and are unable to hold a steady 
job are made up in large part of Negro males between the 
ages of 18 and 25. In the W\ gjfag whi^ W6 SVffYSYfid,, 
Negroes were three times as likely as whites to hold unskilled 
jobs, which are often part time, seasonal, low-paying and "dead 
ftfiH". 

Negro males between the ages of 15 and 25 predominated 
among the rioters. More than 20 percent of the rioters were 
unemployed, and many who were employed held intermittent, 
low status, unskilled jobs which they regarded as below their 
education and ability. 

The Commission recommends that the federal government: 

• Undertake joint efforts with cities and states to consolidate 
existing manpower programs to avoid fragmentation and dupli- 
cation. 

• Take immediate action to create 2,000,000 new jobs over the 
next three years — one million in the public sector and one 
million in the private sector — to absorb the hard-core unem- 
ployed and materially reduce the level of underemployment for 
all workers, black and white. We propose 250,000 public sector 
and 300,000 private sector jobs in the first year. 

• Provide on-the-job training by both public and private employers 
with reimbursement to private employers for the extra costs of 
training the hard-core unemployed, by contract or by tax credits. 

• Provide tax and other incentives to investment in rural as well 
as urban poverty areas in order to offer to the rural poor an 
alternative to migration to urban centers. 

• Take new and vigorous action to remove artificial barriers to 
employment and promotion, including not only racial discrimi- 
nation but, in certain cases, arrest records or lack of a high 
school diploma. Strengthen those agencies such as the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission, charged with eliminating 
discriminatory practices, and provide full support for Title VI 
of the 1964 Civil Rights Act allowing federal grant-in-aid funds 
to be withheld from activities which discriminate on grounds of 
color or race. 

24 


The Commission commends the recent public commitment 
of the National Council of the Building and Construction 
Trades Unions, AFL-CIO, to encourage and recruit Negro 
membership in apprenticeship programs. This commitment 
should be intensified and implemented. 

EDUCATION 

Education in a democratic society must equip children to 
develop their potential and to participate fully in American 
life. For the community at large, the schools have discharged 
this responsibility well. But for many minorities, and particu- 
larly for the children of the ghetto, the schools have failed to 
provide the educational experience which could overcome the 
effects of discrimination and deprivation. 

This failure is one of the persistent sources of grievance 
and resentment within the Negro community. The hostility 
of Negro parents and students toward the school system is 
generating increasing conflict and causing disruption within 
many city school districts. But the most dramatic evidence of 
the relationship between educational practices and civil dis- 
orders lies in the high incidence of riot participation by ghetto 
youth who have not completed high school. 

The bleak record of public education for ghetto children is 
growing worse. In the critical skills — verbal and reading ability 
— Negro students are falling further behind whites with each 
year of school completed. The high unemployment and un- 
deremployment rate for Negro youth is evidence, in part, of 
the growing educational crisis. 

We support integration as the priority education strategy; 
it is essential to the future of American society. In this last 
summer's disorders we have seen the consequences of racial 
isolation at all levels, and of attitudes toward race, on both 
sides, produced by three centuries of myth, ignorance and bias. 
It is indispensable that opportunities for interaction between 
the races be expanded. 

We recognize that the growing dominance of pupils from 
disadvantaged minorities in city school populations will not 
soon be reversed. No matter how great the effort toward de- 
segregation, many children of the ghetto will not, within their 
school careers, attend integrated schools. 

If existing disadvantages are not to be perpetuated, we must 
drastically improve the quality of ghetto education. Equality 
of results with all-white schools must be the goal. 

To implement these strategies, the Commission recommends: 

• Sharply increased efforts to eliminate de facto segregation in our 

25 


schools through substantial federal aid to school systems seeking 
to desegregate either within the system or in cooperation with \ 
neighboring school systems. 

• Elimination of racial discrimination in Northern as well as i 
Southern schools by vigorous application of Title VI of the! 
Civil Rights Act of 1964. 

• Extension of quality early childhood education to every disad- 
vantaged child in the country. 

• Efforts to improve dramatically schools serving disadvantaged' 
children through substantial federal funding of year-round com- 
pensatory education programs, improved teaching, and expanded 
experimentation and research. 

• Elimination of illiteracy through greater federal support for 
adult basic education. 

• Enlarged opportunities for parent and community participation 
in the public schools. 

• Reoriented vocational education emphasizing work-experience 
training and the involvement of business and industry. 

• Expanded opportunities for higher education through increased 
federal assistance to disadvantaged students. 

• Revision of state aid formulas to assure more per student aid 
to districts having a high proportion of disadvantaged school-age 
children. 

THE WELFARE SYSTEM 

Our present system of public welfare is designed to save 
money instead of people, and tragically ends up doing neither. 
This system has two critical deficiencies: 

First, it excludes large numbers of persons who are in great 
need, and who, if provided a decent level of support, might 
be able to become more productive and self-sufficient. No fed- 
eral funds are available for millions of unemployed and under- 
employed men and women who are needy but neither aged, 
handicapped nor the parents of minor children. 

Second, for those included, the system provides assistance 
well below the minimum necessary for a decent level of ex- 
istence, and imposes restrictions that encourage continued de- 
pendency on welfare and undermine self-respect. 

A welter of statutory requirements and administrative prac- 
tices and regulations operate to remind recipients that they 
are considered untrustworthy, promiscuous and lazy. Resi- 
dence requirements prevent assistance to people in need who 
are newly arrived in the state. Searches of recipients' homes 
violate privacy. Inadequate social services compound the 
problems. 

The Commission recommends that the federal government, 
acting with state and local governments where necessary, re- 
form the existing welfare system to: 

• Establish, for recipients in existing welfare categories, uniform 

26 


national standards of assistance at least as high as the annual 
"poverty level" of income, now set by the Social Security Ad- 
ministration at $3,335 per year for an urban family of four. 
;• Require that all states receiving federal welfare contributions 
participate in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children — 
Unemployed Parents program (AFDC-UP) that permits assist- 
ance to families with both father and mother in the home, thus 
aiding the family while it is still intact. 

Bear a substantially greater portion of all welfare costs — at least 
90 percent of total payments. 

• Increase incentives for seeking employment and job training, but 
remove restrictions recently enacted by the Congress that would 
compel mothers of young children to work. 

• Provide more adequate social services through neighborhood 
centers and family-planning programs. 

• Remove the freeze placed by the 1967 welfare amendments on 
the percentage of children in a state that can be covered by 
federal assistance. 

• Eliminate residence requirements. 

As a long-range goal, the Commission recommends that the 
federal government seek to develop a national system of in- 
come supplementation based strictly on need with two broad 
and basic purposes: 

• To provide, for those who can work or who do work, any neces- 
sary supplements in such a way as to develop incentives for 
fuller employment; 

• To provide, for those who cannot work and for mothers who 
decide to remain with their children, a minimum standard of 
decent living, and to aid in the saving of children from the 
prison of poverty that has held their parents. 

A broad system of supplementation would involve substan- 
tially greater federal expenditures than anything now contem- 
plated. The cost will range widely depending on the standard 
of need accepted as the "basic allowance" to individuals and 
families, and on the rate at which additional income above 
this level is taxed. Yet if the deepening cycle of poverty and 
dependence on welfare can be broken, if the children of the 
poor can be given the opportunity to scale the wall that now 
separates them from the rest of society, the return on this 
investment will be great indeed. 

HOUSING 

After more than three decades of fragmented and grossly 
underfunded federal housing programs, nearly six million 
substandard housing units remain occupied in the United 
States. 

27 


The housing problem is particularly acute in the minority 
ghettos. Nearly two-thirds of all non-white families living in 
tiie central cities today live in neighborhoods marked with 
substandard housing and general urban blight. Two major 
factors are responsible. 

First: Many ghetto residents simply cannot pay the rent 
necessary to support decent housing. In Detroit, for example, 
over 40 percent of the non- white occupied units in 1960 
required rent of over 35 percent of the tenants' income. 

Second: Discrimination prevents access to many non-slum 
areas, particularly the suburbs, where good housing exists. In 
addition, by creating a "back pressure" in the racial ghettos, 
it makes it possible for landlords to break up apartments for 
denser occupancy, and keeps prices and rents of deteriorated 
ghetto housing higher than they would be in a truly free 
market. 

To date, federal programs have been able to do compara- 
tively little to provide housing for the disadvantaged. In the 
31 -year history of subsidized federal housing, only about 800,- 
000 units have been constructed, with recent production 
averaging about 50,000 units a year. By comparison, over a 
period only three years longer, FHA insurance guarantees have 
made possible the construction of over ten million middle and 
upper-income units. 

Two points are fundamental to the Commission's recom- 
mendations: 

First: Federal housing programs must be given a new thrust 
aimed at overcoming the prevailing patterns of racial segrega- 
tion. If this is not done, those programs will continue to con- 
centrate the most impoverished and dependent segments of the 
population into the central-city ghettos where there is already 
a critical gap between the needs of the population and the 
public resources to deal with them. 

Second: The private sector must be brought into the produc- 
tion and financing of low and moderate rental housing to sup- 
ply the capabilities and capital necessary to meet the housing 
needs of the nation. 

The Commission recommends that the federal government: 

• Enact a comprehensive and enforceable federal open housing 
law to cover the sale or rental of all housing, including single 
family homes. 

• Reorient federal housing programs to place more low and mod- 
erate income housing outside of ghetto areas. 

• Bring within the reach of low and moderate income families 
within the next five years six million new and existing units of 
decent housing, beginning with 600,000 units in the next year. 

28 


To reach this goal we recommend: 

• Expansion and modification of the rent supplement program to 
permit use of supplements for existing housing, thus greatly in- 
creasing the reach of the program. 

• Expansion and modification of the below-market - interest rate 
program to enlarge the interest subsidy to all sponsors and pro- 
vide interest-free loans to nonprofit sponsors to cover pre-con- 
struction costs, and permit sale of projects to nonprofit corpora- 
tions, cooperatives, or condominiums. 

• Creation of an ownership supplement program similar to present 
rent supplements, to make home ownership possible for low- 
income families. 

• Federal writedown of interest rates on loans to private builders 
constructing moderate-rent housing. 

• Expansion of the public housing program, with emphasis on small 
units on scattered sites, and leasing and "turnkey" programs. 

• Expansion of the Model Cities program. 

• Expansion and reorientation of the urban renewal program to 
give priority to projects directly assisting low-income households 
to obtain adequate housing. 

CONCLUSION 

One of the first witnesses to be invited to appear before this 
Commission was Dr. Kenneth B. Clark, a distinguished and 
perceptive scholar. Referring to the reports of earlier riot 
commissions, he said: 

I read that report ... of the 1919 riot in Chicago, and it is as if 
I were reading the report of the investigating committee on the 
Harlem riot of '35, the report of the investigating committee on 
the Harlem riot of '43, the report of the McCone Commission 
on the Watts riot. 

I must again in candor say to you members of this Commission 
— it is a kind of Alice in Wonderland — with the same moving 
picture re-shown over and over again, the same analysis, the 
same recommendations, and the same inaction. 

These words come to our minds as we conclude this report. 

We have provided an honest beginning. We have learned 
much. But we have uncovered no startling truths, no unique 
insights, no simple solutions. The destruction and the bitterness 
of racial disorder, the harsh polemics of black revolt and white 
repression have been seen and heard before in this country. 

It is time now to end the destruction and the violence, not 
only in the streets of the ghetto but in the lives of people.

Preface 


The summer of 1967 brought racial disorder again to 
American cities, deepening the bitter residue of fear and threat- 
ening the future of all Americans. 

We are charged by the President with the responsibility 
to examine this condition and to speak the truth as we see it. 
Two fundamental questions confront us: 

How can we as a people end the resort to violence while 
we build a better society? 

How can the nation realize the promise of a single society 
—one nation indivisible — which yet remains unfulfilled? 

Violence surely cannot build that society. Disruption and 
disorder will nourish not justice but repression. Those few 
who would destroy civil order and the rule of law strike at the 
freedom of every citizen. They must know that the community 
cannot and will not tolerate coercion and mob action. 

We have worked together these past months with a sense 
of the greatest urgency. Although much remains that can be 
learned, we have determined to say now what we have 
learned. We do this in the hope that the American public will 
understand the nature and gravity of the problem and that 
those who have power to act — at all levels of government and 
in all sections of the community — will listen and respond. 

This sense of urgency has led us to consolidate in this 
single report the interim and final reports called for by the 
President. To accomplish this, it has been necessary to do with- 
out the benefit of some studies still under way which will not 
be completed for months to come. Certain of these studies — a 
15-city survey of Negro and white attitudes, a special survey 
of attitudes of community leaders, elected officials, adminis- 
trators and teachers, a report on the application of mediation 
techniques, and a further analysis of riot arrestees — will be 
issued later, with other materials, as supplemental reports. 

We believe that to wait until mid-summer to present our 
findings and recommendations may be to forfeit whatever 

31 


opportunity exists for this report to affect this year the danger- 
ous climate of tension and apprehension that pervades our 
cities. 

II 

Last summer nearly 150 cities reported disorders in 
Negro — and in some instances, Puerto Rican — neighbor- 
hoods. These ranged from minor disturbances to major out- 
bursts involving sustained and widespread looting and destruc- 
tion of property. The worst came during a two-week period in 
July when large-scale disorders erupted first in Newark and 
then in Detroit, each setting off a chain reaction in neighboring 
communities. 

It was in this troubled and turbulent setting that the Presi- 
dent of the United States established this Commission. He 
called upon it "to guide the country through a thicket of 
tension, conflicting evidence and extreme opinions." 

In his charge, the President framed the Commission's 
mandate in these words: 

"We need to know the answers to three 
basic questions  about these riots: 
— What happened? 
— Why did it happen? 
— What can be done to 
prevent it from happen- 
ing again and again?" 

The three parts of this report offer answers to these questions. 

Part I tells "What happened?" Chapter 1 is a profile of 
the 1967 disorders told through a narrative of the summer's 
events in 10 of the 23 cities surveyed by the Commission. 
Chapter 2 calls on data from all 23 cities to construct an 
analytical profile. Chapter 3 is the report of the Commission 
on the issue of conspiracy. 

Part II responds to the question "Why did it happen?" 
Early in our investigation it became clear that the disorders 
were not the result of contemporary conditions alone; Chapter 

5 identifies some of the historical factors that are an essential 
part of the background of last summer's outbreaks. Chapters 

6 through 9 deal with present conditions, examining the impact 
of ghetto formation, unemployment, and family structures, and 
conditions of life in the ghettos, and the differences between 

32 


the Negro experience and that of other urban immigrant 
groups. 

Part III contains our answer to the question "What can 
be done?" Our recommendations begin with organizing the 
community to respond more effectively to ghetto needs and 
then proceed with police-community relations, control of 
disorders, the administration of justice under emergency con- 
ditions, compensation for property damage, the role of the 
news media, and national action in the critical areas of employ- 
ment, education, welfare and housing. 

In formulating this report, we have attempted to draw 
on all relevant sources. During closed hearings held from 
August through December, we heard over 130 witnesses, in- 
cluding federal, state and local officials, experts from the 
military establishment and law enforcement agencies, univer- 
sities and foundations, Negro leaders and representatives of 
the business community. We personally visited eight cities in 
which major disturbances had occurred. We met together for 
24 days to review and revise the several drafts of our report. 
Through our staff we also undertook field surveys in 23 cities 
in which disorders occurred during the summer of 1967, and 
took sworn testimony in nine of the cities investigated and 
from Negro leaders and militants across the country. Expert 
consultants and advisors supplemented the work of our staff 
in all the areas covered in our report. 

in 

Much of our report is directed to the condition of those 
Americans who are also Negroes and to the social and 
economic environment in which they live — many in the black 
ghettos of our cities. But this nation is confronted with the 
issue of justice for all its people — white as well as black, rural 
as well as urban. In particular, we are concerned for those 
who have continued to keep faith with society in the preser- 
vation of public order — the people of Spanish surname, the 
American Indian and other minority groups to whom this 
country owes so much. 

We wish it to be clear that in focusing on the Negro, we do 
not mean to imply any priority of need. It will not do to fight 
misery in the black ghetto and leave untouched the reality 
of injustice and deprivation elsewhere in our society. The first 
priority is order and justice for all Americans. 

In speaking of the Negro, we do not speak of "them." 

33 


We speak of us — for the freedoms and opportunities of all 
Americans are diminished and imperiled when they are denied 
to some Americans. The tragic waste of human spirit and 
resources, the unrecoverable loss to the nation which this 
denial has already caused — and continues to produce — no 
longer can be ignored or afforded. 

Two premises underlie the work of the Commission: 

• that this nation cannot abide violence and disorder 
if it is to ensure the safety of its people and their 
progress in a free society. 

• that this nation will deserve neither safety nor prog- 
ress unless it can demonstrate the wisdom and the 
will to undertake decisive action against the root 
causes of racial disorder. 

This report is addressed to the institutions of government 
and to the conscience of the nation, but even more urgently, 
to the minds and hearts of each citizen. The responsibility for 
decisive action, never more clearly demanded in the history 
of our country, rests on all of us. 

We do not know whether the tide of racial disorder has 
begun to recede. We recognize as we must that the condi- 
tions underlying the disorders will not be obliterated before 
the end of this year or the end of the next and that, so long 
as these conditions exist, a potential for disorder remains. But 
we believe that the likelihood of disorder can be markedly 
lessened by an American commitment to confront those con- 
ditions and eliminate them — a commitment so clear that Negro 
citizens will know its truth and accept its goal. The most im- 
portant step toward domestic peace is an act of will; this 
country can do for its people what it chooses to do. 

The pages that follow set forth our conclusions and the 
facts upon which they are based. Our plea for civil order and 
our recommendations for social and economic change are a 
call to national action. We are aware of the breadth and scope 
of those recommendations but they neither probe deeper nor 
demand more than the problems which call them forth.

PART I 

what happened; 


Chapter 1 / Profiles of Disorder 


Introduction 

The President directed the Commission to produce "a pro- 
file of the riots — of the rioters, of their environment, of their 
victims, of their causes and effects." 

In response to this mandate the Commission constructed 
profiles of the riots in 10 of the 23 cities under investigation. 
Brief summaries of what were often conflicting views and 
perceptions of confusing episodes, they are, we believe, a fair 
and accurate picture of what happened. 

From the profiles, we have sought to build a composite view 
of the riots as well as of the environment out of which they 
erupted. 


The summer of 1967 was not the beginning of the current 
wave of disorders. Omens of violence had appeared much 
earlier. 

1963-64 

In 1963, serious disorders, involving both whites and Ne- 
groes, broke out in Birmingham, Savannah, Cambridge, Md., 
Chicago, and Philadelphia. Sometimes the mobs battled each 
other; more often they fought the police. 

The most violent encounters took place in Birmingham. 
Police used dogs, firehoses and cattle prods against marchers, 
many of whom were children. White racists shot at Negroes 
and bombed Negro residences. Negroes retaliated by burning 
white-owned businesses in Negro areas. On a quiet Sunday 
morning, a bomb exploded beneath a Negro church. Four 
young girls in a Sunday school class were killed. 

In the spring of 1964, the arrest and conviction of civil 

35 


rights demonstrators provoked violence in Jacksonville. A 
shot fired from a passing car killed a Negro woman. When a 
bomb threat forced evacuation of an all-Negro high school, 
the students stoned policemen and firemen and burned the cars 
of newsmen. For the first time, Negroes used Molotov cocktails 
in setting fires. 

Two weeks later, at a demonstration protesting school segre- 
gation in Cleveland, a bulldozer accidentally killed a young 
white minister. When police moved in to disperse a crowd 
composed primarily of Negroes, violence erupted. 

In late June, white segregationists broke through police lines 
and attacked civil rights demonstrators in St. Augustine, 
Florida. In Philadelphia, Mississippi, law enforcement officers 
were implicated in the lynch murders of three civil rights 
workers. On July 10 Ku Klux Klansmen shot and killed a 
Negro United States Army lieutenant colonel, Lemuel Penn, 
as he was driving through Georgia. 

On July 16, in New York City, several young Negroes walk- 
ing to summer school classes became involved in a dispute with 
a white building superintendent. When an off-duty police 
lieutenant intervened, a 15-year-old boy attacked him with a 
knife. The officer shot and killed the boy. 

A crowd of teenagers gathered and smashed store windows. 
Police arrived in force, and dispersed the group. 

On the following day, the Progressive Labor Movement, a 
Marxist-Leninist organization, printed and passed out inflam- 
matory leaflets charging the police with brutality. 

On the second day after the shooting, a rally called by the 
Congress of Racial Equality to protest the Mississippi lynch 
murders developed into a march on a precinct police station. 
The crowd clashed with the police; one person was killed, and 
12 police officers and 19 citizens were injured. 

For several days thereafter the pattern was repeated: despite 
exhortations of Negro community leaders against violence, 
protest rallies became uncontrollable. Police battled mobs in 
Harlem and in the Bedford Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. 
Firemen fought fires started with Molotov cocktails. When 
bricks and bottles were thrown, police responded with gunfire. 
Widespread looting followed and many persons were injured. 

A week later a riot broke out in Rochester when police 
tried to arrest an intoxicated Negro youth at a street dance. 
After two days of violence, the National Guard restored order. 

During the first two weeks of August, disorders took place 
in three New Jersey communities: Jersey City, Elizabeth, and 
Paterson. 

On August 15, when a white liquor store owner in the Chi- 
cago suburb of Dixmoor had a Negro woman arrested for 

36 


stealing a bottle of whiskey, he was accused of having man- 
handled her. A crowd gathered in front of the store, broke 
the store window, and threw rocks at passing cars. The police 
restored order. The next day, when the disturbance was re- 
newed, a Molotov cocktail set the liquor store afire. Several 
persons were injured. 

The final violence of the summer occurred in Philadelphia. 
A Negro couple's car stalled at an intersection in an area 
known as "The Jungle" — where, with almost 2,000 persons 
living in each block, there is the greatest incidence of crime, 
disease, unemployment, and poverty occurs in the city. When 
two police officers, one white and one black, attempted to move 
the car, the wife of the owner became abusive and the officers 
arrested her. Police officers and Negro spectators gathered at 
the scene. Two nights of rioting, resulting in extensive damage. 

1965 

In the spring of 1965, the nation's attention shifted back 
to the South. When civil rights workers staged a nonviolent 
demonstration in Selma, Alabama, police and state troopers 
forcibly interrupted their march. Within the next few weeks 
racists murdered a white clergyman and a white housewife 
active in civil rights. 

In the small Louisiana town of Bogalusa, when Negro 
demonstrators attacked by whites received inadequate police 
protection, the Negroes formed a self-defense group called 
the "Deacons for Defense and Justice." 

As late as the second week of August, there had been few 
disturbances outside the South. But, on the evening of August 
1 1, as Los Angeles sweltered in a heat wave, a highway patrol- 
man halted a young Negro driver for speeding. The young 
man appeared intoxicated, and the patrolman arrested him. As 
a crowd gathered, law enforcement officers were called to the 
scene. A highway patrolman mistakenly struck a bystander 
with his billy club. A young Negro woman, who was accused 
of spitting on the police, was dragged into the middle of the 
street. 

When the police departed, members of the crowd began 
hurling rocks at passing cars, beating white motorists, and over- 
turning cars and setting them on fire. The police reacted hesi- 
tantly. Actions they did take further inflamed the people on 
the streets. 

The following day the area was calm. Community leaders 
attempting to mediate between Negro residents and the police 
received little cooperation from municipal authorities. That 
evening the previous night's pattern of violence was repeated. 

37 


Not until almost 30 hours after the initial flareup did window 
smashing, looting, and arson begin. Yet the police utilized 
only a small part of their forces. 

Few police were on hand the next morning when huge 
crowds gathered in the business district of Watts, two miles 
from the location of the original disturbance, and began loot- 
ing. In the absence of police response, the looting became 
bolder and spread into other areas. Hundreds of women and 
children from five housing projects clustered in or near Watts 
took part. Around noon, extensive firebombing began. Few 
white persons were attacked; the principal intent of the rioters 
now seemed to be to destroy property owned by whites, in 
order to drive white "exploiters" out of the ghetto. 

The chief of police asked for National Guard help, but the 
arrival of the military units was delayed for several hours. 
When the Guardsmen arrived, they, together with police, made 
heavy use of firearms. Reports of "sniper fire" increased. Sev- 
eral persons were killed by mistake. Many more were injured. 

Thirty-six hours after the first Guard units arrived, the main 
force of the riot had been blunted. Almost 4,000 persons were 
arrested. Thirty-four were killed and hundreds injured. Ap- 
proximately $35 million in damage had been inflicted. 

The Los Angeles riot, the worst in the United States since 
the Detroit riot of 1943, shocked all who had been confident 
that race relations were improving in the North, and evoked a 
new mood in the Negro ghettos around the country. 

1966 

The events of 1966 made it appear that domestic turmoil had 
become part of the American scene. 

In March, a fight between several Negroes and Mexican- 
Americans resulted in a new flareup in Watts. In May, after a 
police officer accidentally shot and killed a Negro, demonstra- 
tions by Negro militants again increased tension in Los 
Angeles. 

Evidence was accumulating that a major proportion of riot 
participants were youths. Increasing race pride, skepticism 
about their job prospects, and dissatisfaction with the inade- 
quacy of their education, caused unrest among students in Ne- 
gro colleges and high schools throughout the country. Students 
and youths were the principal participants in at least six of the 
13 spring and early summer disorders of 1966. 

July 12, 1966, was a hot day in Chicago. Negro youngsters 
were playing in water gushing from an illegally opened fire 
hydrant. Two police officers, arriving on the scene closed the 
hydrant. A Negro youth turned it on again, and the police offi- 

38 


cers arrested him. A crowd gathered. Police reinforcements 
arrived. As the crowd became unruly, seven Negro youths were 
arrested. 

Rumors spread that the arrested youths had been beaten, 
and that police were turning off fire hydrants in Negro 
neighborhoods but leaving them on in white areas. Sporadic 
window breaking, rock throwing, and firebombing lasted for 
several hours. Most of the participants were teenagers. 

In Chicago, as in other cities, the long-standing grievances 
of the Negro community needed only minor incidents to trigger 
violence. 

In 1961 when Negroes, after being evacuated from a burn- 
ing tenement, had been sheltered in a church in an all-white 
area, a crowd of residents had gathered and threatened to at- 
tack the church unless the Negroes were removed. 

Segregated schools and housing had led to repeated picketing 
and marches by civil rights organizations. When marchers had 
gone into white neighborhoods, they had been met on several 
occasions by KKK signs and crowds throwing eggs and to- 
matoes. In 1965, when a Chicago fire truck had killed a Negro 
woman in an accident, Negroes had congregated to protest 
against the fire station's all-white complement. Rock throwing 
and looting had broken out. More than 170 persons were ar- 
rested in two days. 

On the evening of July 13, 1966, the day after the fire 
hydrant incident, rock throwing, looting and fire-bombing 
began again. For several days thereafter the pattern of vio- 
lence was repeated. Police responding to calls were subjected to 
random gunfire. Rumors spread. The press talked in highly 
exaggerated terms of "guerrilla warfare" and "sniper fire." 

Before the police and 4,200 National Guardsmen managed 
to restore order, scores of civilians and police had been injured. 
There were 533 arrests, including 155 juveniles. Three Negroes 
were killed by stray bullets, among them a 13-year-old boy and 
a 14-year-old pregnant girl. 

Less than a week later, Ohio National Guardsmen were 
mobilized to deal with an outbreak of rioting that continued for 
four nights in the Hough section of Cleveland. It is probable 
that Negro extremists, although they neither instigated nor or- 
ganized the disorder, exploited and enlarged it. Amidst wide- 
spread reports of "sniper fire," four Negroes, including one 
young woman, were killed; many others, several children 
among them, were injured. Law enforcement officers were 
responsible for two of the deaths, a white man firing from a 
car for a third, and a group of young white vigilantes for the 
fourth. 

Some news media keeping "tally sheets" of the disturbances 

39 


began to apply the term "riot" to acts of vandalism and rela- 
tively minor disorders. 

At the end of July, the National States Rights Party, a white 
extremist organization that advocates deporting Negroes and 
other minorities, preached racial hatred at a series of rallies in 
Baltimore. Bands of white youths were incited into chasing and 
beating Negroes. A court order halted the rallies. 

Forty-three disorders and riots were reported during 1966. 
Although there were considerable variations in circumstances, 
intensity, and length, they were usually ignited by a minor 
incident fueled by antagonism between the Negro population 
and the police. 

Spring 1967 

In the spring of 1967 disorders broke out at three Southern 
Negro universities at which SNCC (Student Non- Violent Co- 
ordinating Committee), a militant anti-white organization, had 
been attempting to organize the students. 

On Friday, April 7, learning that Stokely Carmichael was 
speaking at two primarily Negro universities, Fisk and Tennes- 
see A&I, in Nashville, and receiving information that some per- 
sons were preparing to riot, the police adopted an emergency 
riot plan. On the following day Carmichael and others, includ- 
ing South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond, spoke at a sym- 
posium at Vanderbilt University. 

That evening the Negro operator of a restaurant located near 
Fisk University summoned police to arrest an allegedly intoxi- 
cated Negro soldier. 

Within a few minutes students, many of them members of 
SNCC, began to picket the restaurant. A squad of riot police 
arrived and soon became the focus of attention. Spectators 
gathered. When a city bus was halted and attacked by mem- 
bers of the crowd, a Negro police lieutenant fired five shots 
into the air. 

Rocks and bottles were thrown, and additional police were 
called into the area. Officers fired a number of shots over the 
heads of the crowd. The students and spectators gradually dis- 
persed. 

On the following evening, after negotiations between stu- 
dents and police broke down, crowds again began forming. 
Police fired over their heads, and shots were fired back at the 
police. On the fringes of the campus several white youths aimed 
shots at a police patrol wagon. 

A few days later, when police raided the home of several 
young Negro militants, they confiscated a half dozen bottles 
prepared as Molotov cocktails. 

40 


About a month later, students at Jackson State College, in 
Jackson, Mississippi, were standing around after a political, 
rally when two Negro police officers pursued a speeding car, 
driven by a Negro student, onto the campus. When the officers 
tried to arrest the driver, the students interfered. The police 
called for reinforcements. A crowd of several hundred persons 
quickly gathered, and a few rocks were thrown. 

On the following evening, an even larger crowd assembled. 
When police attempted to disperse it by gunfire, three persons 
were hit. One of them, a young Negro, died the next day. The 
National Guard restored order. 

Six days later, on May 16, two separate Negro protests were 
taking place in Houston. One group was picketing a garbage 
dump in a Negro residential neighborhood, where a Negro 
child had drowned. Another was demonstrating at a junior 
high school on the grounds that Negro students were disci- 
plined more harshly than white. 

That evening college students who had participated in the 
protests returned to the campus of Texas Southern University. 
About 50 of them were grouped around a 21 -year-old student, 
D. W., a Vietnam veteran, who was seeking to stimulate fur- 
ther protest action. A dispute broke out, and D. W. reportedly 
slapped another student. When the student threatened D. W. 
he left, armed himself with a pistol, and returned. 

In response to the report of a disturbance, two unmarked 
police cars with four officers arrived. Two of the officers ques- 
tioned D. W., discovered he was armed with a pistol, and 
arrested him. 

A short time later, when one of the police cars returned to 
the campus, it was met by rocks and bottles thrown by students. 
As police called for reinforcements, sporadic gunshots re- 
portedly came from the men's dormitory. The police returned 
the fire. 

For several hours, gunfire punctuated unsuccessful attempts 
by community leaders to negotiate a truce between the students 
and the police. 

When several tar barrels were set afire in the street and 
shooting broke out again, police decided to enter the dormitory. 
A patrolman, struck by a ricocheting bullet, was killed. After 
clearing all 480 occupants from the building, police searched 
it and found one shotgun and two .22 caliber pistols. The 
origin of the shot that killed the officer was not determined. 

As the summer of 1967 approached, Americans, conditioned 
by three years of reports of riots, expected violence. But they 
had no answers to hard questions: What was causing the tur- 
moil? Was it organized and, if so, by whom? Was there a pat- 
tern to the disorders? 

41 


I. Tampa 

On Sunday, June 11, 1967, Tampa, Florida, sweltered in 
the 94-degree heat. A humid wind ruffled the bay, where 
thousands of persons watched the hydroplane races. Since 
early morning the Police Department's Selective Enforcement 
Unit, designed as a riot control squad, had been employed to 
keep order at the races. 

At 5:30 P.M., a block from the waterfront, a photo supply 
warehouse was broken into. Forty-five minutes later two police 
officers spotted three Negro youths as they walked near the 
State Building. When the youths caught sight of the officers, 
they ducked into an alley. The officers gave chase. As they ran, 
the suspects left a trail of photographic equipment scattered 
from yellow paper bags they were carrying. 

The officers transmitted a general broadcast over the police 
radio. As other officers arrived on the scene, a chase began 
through and around the streets, houses, and alleys of the neigh- 
borhood. When Negro residents of the area adjacent to the 
Central Park Village Housing Project became aware of the 
chase, they began to participate. Some attempted to help the 
officers in locating the suspects. 

R. C. Oates, one of 17 Negros on the 51 1-man Tampa police 
force, spotted 19-year-old Martin Chambers, bare to the waist, 
wriggling away beneath one of the houses. Oates called for 
Chambers to surrender. Ignoring him, Chambers emerged 
running from beneath the house. A white officer, J. L. Calvert, 
took up the pursuit. 

Pursuing Calvert, in turn, were three young Negroes, all 
spectators. Behind one of the houses a high cyclone fence 
created a two-foot wide alley twenty-five feet in length. 

As Chambers darted along the fence, Officer Calvert rounded 
the corner of the house. Calvert yelled to him to halt. Cham- 
bers ignored him. Calvert pointed his .38 revolver and fired. 
The slug entered the back of Chambers and passed completely 
through his body. Raising his hands over his head, he clutched 
at the cyclone fence. 

When the three youths running behind Officer Calvert came 
upon the scene, they assumed Chambers had been shot stand- 
ing in the position in which they saw him. Rumor quickly 
spread through the neighborhood that a white police officer 
had shot a Negro youth who had had his hands over his head 
and was trying to surrender. 

The ambulance that had been summoned became lost on the 
way. The gathering crowd viewing the bloody, critically in- 
jured youth grew increasingly belligerent. 

42 


Finally, Officer Oates loaded Chambers into his car and 
drove him to the hospital. The youth died shortly thereafter. 

As officers were leaving the scene, a thunderstorm broke. 
Beneath the pelting rain, the spectators scattered. When an 
officer went back to check the area he found no one on the 
streets. 

A few minutes after 7:00 P.M., the Selective Enforcement 
Unit, tired and sun-parched, reported in from the races. A 
half hour later a report was received that 500 persons were 
gathering. A police car was sent into the area to check the 
report. The officers could find no one. The men of the Selective 
Enforcement Unit were told to go home. 

The men in the scout car had not, however, penetrated into 
the Central Park Village Housing complex where, as the rain 
ended, hundreds of persons poured from the apartments. At 
least half were teenagers and young adults. As they began to 
mill about and discuss the shooting, old grievances, both real 
and imagined, were resurrected: discriminatory practices of 
local stores, advantages taken by white men of Negro girls, the 
kicking in the face of a Negro boy by a white man as the Negro 
lay handcuffed on the ground, blackballing of two Negro high 
schools by the athletic conference. 

Although officials prided themselves on supposedly good 
race relations and relative acceptance by whites of integration 
of schools and facilities, Negroes, composing almost 20 percent 
of the population,1 had had no one of their own race to repre- 
sent them in positions of policy or power, nor to appeal to for 
redress of grievances. 

There was no Negro on the city council; none on the school 
board: none in the fire department; none of high rank on the 
police force. Six of every 10 houses inhabited by Negroes were 
unsound. Many were shacks with broken window panes, gas 
leaks, and rat holes in the walls. Rents averaged $50 to $60 a 
month. Such recreational facilities as did exist lacked equipment 
and supervisors. Young toughs intimidated the children who 
tried to use them. 

The majority of Negro children never reached the eighth 
grade. In the high schools, only 3 to 4 percent of Negro seniors 
attained the minimum passing score on the State's college en- 
trance examination, one-tenth the percentage of white students. 

A difference of at least three-and-a-half years in educational 
attainment separated the average Negro and white. Fifty-five 

1 Throughout the report, in the presentation of statistics Negro is used inter- 
changeably with non-white. Wherever available, current data are used. Where 
no updating has been possible, figures are those of the 1960 census. Sources 
are the U.S. Bureau of the Census and other government agencies, and, in a 
few instances, special studies. 

43 


percent of the Negro men in Tampa were working in unskilled 
jobs. More than half of the families had incomes of less than 
$3,000 a year. The result was that 40 percent of the Negro 
children lived in broken homes, and the city's crime rate ranked 
in the top 25 percent in the nation. 

About a month before, police-community relations had been 
severely strained by the actions of a pair of white officers who 
were subsequently transferred to another beat. 

When Officer Oates returned to the area he attempted to 
convince the crowd to disperse by announcing that a complete 
investigation would be made into the shooting. He seemed to 
be making headway when a young woman came running down 
the street screaming that the police had killed her brother. Her 
hysteria galvanized the crowd. Rock throwing began. Police 
cars driving into the area were stoned. The police, relying on a 
previous experience when, after withdrawal of their units, the 
crowd had dispersed, decided to send no more patrol cars into 
the vicinity. 

This time the maneuver did not work. From nearby bars and 
tawdry night spots patrons joined the throng. A window was 
smashed. Haphazard looting began. As fluid bands of rioters 
moved down the Central Avenue business district, stores whose 
proprietors were particularly disliked were singled out. A 
grocery store, a liquor store, a restaurant were hit. The first 
fire was set. 

Because of the dismissal of the Selective Enforcement Unit 
and the lack of accurate intelligence information, the police de- 
partment was slow to react. Although Sheriff Malcolm Beard 
of Hillsborough County was in contact with the Department 
throughout the evening, it was not until after 11:00 P.M. that 
a request for deputies was made to him 

At 11:30 P.M. a recall order, issued earlier by the police 
department, began to bring officers back into the area. By this 
time, the streets in the vicinity of the housing project were 
lighted by the flames of burning buildings. 

Falling power lines whipped sparks about the skirmish line 
of officers as they moved down the street. The popping noise of 
what sounded to the officers like gunshots came from the direc- 
tion of the housing project. 

The officers did not return the fire. Police announced from 
a sound car that anyone caught armed would be shot. The fir- 
ing ceased. Then, and throughout the succeeding two days, law 
enforcement officers refrained from the use of firearms. No 
officer or civilian suffered a gunshot wound during the riot. 

Driving along the expressway, a young white couple, Mr. 
and Mrs. C. D., were startled by the fires. Deciding to investi- 
gate, they took the off-ramp into the midst of the riot. The 

44 


car was swarmed over. Its windows were shattered. C. D. was 
dragged into the street. 

As he emerged from a bar in which he had spent the eve- 
ning, 19-year old J. C, a Negro fruit-picker from Arkansas, 
was as surprised by the riot as Mr. and Mrs. C. D. Rushing 
toward the station wagon in which the young woman was 
trapped, he interposed himself between her and the mob. 
Although rocks and beer cans smashed the windows, she was 
able to drive off. J. C. pushed through to where the white man 
lay. With the hoots and jeers of rioting youths ringing in his 
ears, J. C. helped him, also, to escape. 

By 1:00 A.M., police officers and sheriffs deputies had 
surrounded an area several blocks square. Firemen began to 
extinguish the flames which, by this time, had spread to several 
other establishments from the three stores in which they had, 
originally, been set. No resistance was met. Control was soon 
re-established. 

Governor Claude Kirk flew to Tampa. Since the chief of 
police was absent, and since the Governor regarded the sheriff 
as his "direct arm," Sheriff Beard was placed in charge of 
the combined forces of the police and sheriff's departments. 
For the next 12 hours the situation remained quiet but 
tense. By afternoon of Monday, June 12, the sheriffs and 
police forces both had been fully committed. The men were 
tired. There were none in reserve. 

As a precaution, the Sheriff requested that a National Guard 
contingent be made available. 

Late in the afternoon Governor Kirk met with the residents 
at a school in the Central Park Village area. It was a tense 
meeting. Most speakers, whether white or Negro, were booed 
and hissed. The meeting broke up without concrete results. 
Nevertheless, the Governor believed it had enabled the resi- 
dents to let off steam. 

That evening, as National Guard troops began to supplant 
local forces in maintaining a perimeter and establishing roving 
patrols, anti-poverty workers went from door to door, urging 
citizens to stay off the streets. 

A reported attempt by Black Muslims to incite further 
violence failed. Although there were scattered reports of 
trouble from several areas of the city, and a few fires were 
set — largely in vacant buildings — there were no major inci- 
dents. Several youths with a cache of Molotov cocktails were 
arrested. They were white. 

All the next day false reports poured into Police Head- 
quarters. Everyday scenes took on menacing tones. Twenty 
Negro men, bared to the waist and carrying clubs were re- 

45 


ported to be gathering. They turned out to be construction 
workers. 

Mayor Nuccio met with residents. At their suggestion that 
the man most likely to carry weight with the youngsters was 
Coach Jim Williams, he placed a call to Tallahassee, where 
Williams was attending a coaching clinic. 

An impressive-looking man with graying hair, Williams ar- 
rived in Tampa almost 48 hours after the shooting of Martin 
Chambers. Together with another coach he went to an eatery 
called The Greek Stand, behind which he found a number 
of youngsters fashioning an arsenal of bottles, bricks, and 
Molotov cocktails. As in the crowds that were once more 
beginning to gather, the principal complaint was the presence 
of the National Guard, which, the residents asserted, gave 
them a feeling of being hemmed in. Williams decided to at- 
tempt to negotiate the removal of the National Guard if the 
people would agree to keep the peace and to disperse. 

When Sheriff Beard arrived at a meeting called for the 
College Hill Elementary School, Robert Gilder of the NAACP 
was speaking to leaders of the Negro youth. Some were college 
students who had been unable to get summer jobs. One was 
a Vietnam veteran who had been turned down for a position 
as a swimming pool lifeguard. The youths believed that dis- 
crimination had played a part in their failure to find jobs. 

The suggestion was made to Sheriff Beard that the National 
Guard be pulled out of the Negro areas, and that these young 
men, as well as others, be given the opportunity to keep order. 
The idea, which was encouraged by James Hammond, Di- 
rector of the Commission of Community Relations, made 
sense to the Sheriff. He decided to take a chance on the 
Youth Patrol. 

In another part of the city, West Tampa, two Negro com- 
munity leaders, Dr. James O. Brookins and attorney Delano 
S. Stewart, were advised by acquaintances that, unless the in- 
tensive patrolling of Negro neighborhoods ceased, people 
planned to set fires in industrial districts that evening. Like 
Coach Williams, Dr. Brookins and Stewart contacted neigh- 
borhood youths, and invited Sheriff Beard to a meeting. The 
concept of the Youth Patrol was expanded. Participants were 
identified first by phosphorescent arm bands, and later by 
white hats. 

During the next 24 hours 126 youths, some of whom had 
participated in the riot, were recruited into the patrol. Many 
were high school dropouts. 

On Wednesday, the inquiry into the death of Martin 
Chambers was concluded. With the verdict that Officer Cal- 
vert had fired the shot justifiably and in the line of duty, ap- 

46 


prehension rose that trouble would erupt again. The leaders 
of the Youth Patrol were called in. The Sheriff explained the 
law to them, and pointed out that the verdict was in con- 
formance with the law. Despite the fact that the verdict was 
not to their liking, the White Hats continued to keep order. 

II.  Cincinnati 

On Monday, June 12, before order had been restored in 
Tampa, trouble erupted 940 miles away in Cincinnati. 

Beginning in October, 1965, assaults on middle-aged white 
women, several of whom were murdered, had generated an 
atmosphere of fear. When the "Cincinnati Strangler" was ten- 
tatively identified as a Negro, a new element of tension was 
injected into relations between the races. 

In December, 1966, a Negro jazz musician named Posteal 
Laskey was arrested and charged with one of the murders. 
In May of 1967 he was convicted and sentenced to death. 
Two of the principal witnesses against Laskey were Negroes. 
Nevertheless, many Negroes felt that, because of the charged 
atmosphere, he had not received a fair trial. 

They were further aroused when, at about the same time, 
a white man, convicted of manslaughter in the death of his 
girlfriend, received a suspended sentence. Although the cases 
were dissimilar, there was talk in the Negro community that 
the difference in the sentences demonstrated a double standard 
of justice for white and for black. 

A drive began in the Negro community to raise funds for 
an appeal. Laskey's cousin, Peter Frakes, began walking the 
streets on behalf of this appeal carrying a sandwich board 
declaring: "Cincinnati Guilty — Laskey Innocent." After warn- 
ing him several times, police arrested Frakes on a charge of 
blocking pedestrian traffic. 

Many Negroes viewed his arrest as evidence of police 
harassment, similar to the apparently selective enforcement 
of the city's anti-loitering ordinance. Between January, 1966, 
and June, 1967, 170 of some 240 persons arrested under the 
ordinance were Negro. 

Frakes was arrested at 12:35 A.M. on Sunday, June 11. 
That evening, concurrently with the commencement of a Ne- 
gro Baptist Convention, it was announced in one of the 
churches that a meeting to protest the Frakes arrest and the 
anti-loitering ordinance would be held the following night on 
the grounds of a junior high school in the Avondale District. 

Part of the significance of such a protest meeting lay in the 
context of past events. Without the city's realizing what was 
occurring, over the years protest through political and non- 
47 


violent channels had become increasingly difficult for Negroes. 
To young, militant Negroes, especially, such protest appeared 
to have become almost futile. 

Although the city's Negro population had been rising swiftly 
—in 1967, 135,000 out of the city's 500,000 residents were 
Negroes — there was only one Negro on the city council. In 
the 1950's, with a far smaller Negro population, there had 
been two. Negroes attributed this to dilution of the Negro 
vote through abolition of the proportional representation sys- 
tem of electing the nine councilmen. 

Although, by 1967, 40 percent of the school children were 
Negro, there was only one Negro on the Board of Education. 
Of more than 80 members of various city commissions, only 
three or four were Negro. 

Under the leadership of the NAACP, picketing, to protest 
lack of Negro membership in building trades unions, took 
place at the construction site of a new city convention hall. 
It produced no results. When the Reverend Fred Shuttles- 
worth, who had been one of the leaders of the Birmingham 
demonstrations of 1963, staged a protest against alleged dis- 
criminatory practices at the County Hospital, he and his fol- 
lowers were arrested and convicted of trespassing. 

Traditional Negro leaders drawn from the middle class lost 
influence as promises made by the city produced petty results. 
In the spring of 1967, a group of 14 white and 14 Negro 
business and community leaders, called the Committee of 28, 
talked about 2,000 job openings for young Negroes. Only 65 
materialized. Almost one out of every eight Cincinnati Ne- 
groes was unemployed. Two of every five Negro families were 
living on or below the border of poverty. 

A study of the West End section of the city indicated that 
one out of every four Negro men living there was out of 
work. In one public housing area two-thirds of the fathers 
were missing. Of private housing occupied by Negroes, one- 
fourth was overcrowded, and half was deteriorated or di- 
lapidated. 

In the 90-degree temperature of Monday, June 12th, as 
throughout the summer, Negro youngsters roamed the streets. 
The two swimming pools available to them could accommo- 
date only a handful. In the Avondale section — once a pros- 
perous white middle class community, but now the home of 
more than half the city's Negro population — Negro youths 
watched white workers going to work at white-owned stores 
and businesses. One youth began to count the number of 
delivery trucks being driven by Negroes. During the course 

48 


of the afternoon, of the 52 trucks he counted, only one had 
a Negro driver. His sampling was remarkably accurate. Ac- 
cording to a study conducted by the Equal Employment Op- 
portunities Commission, less than 2 percent of truck drivers 
in the Cincinnati area are Negro. 

Late in the afternoon the youths began to interfere with 
deliveries being made by white drivers. Dr. Bruce Green, 
president of the local NAACP chapter, was notified. Dr. 
Green asked his colleague, Dr. Robert Reid, the director of 
the Opportunities Industrialization Center, to go and try to 
calm the youngsters. Dr. Reid found several whom he knew, 
and convinced them to go with him to the Avondale Special 
Services Office to talk things over. 

They were drawing up plans for a meeting with merchants 
of the Avondale area when word came of an altercation at 
a nearby drugstore. Several of the youths left the meeting 
and rushed over to the store. Dr. Reid followed them. The 
owner of the store was complaining to the police that earlier 
the youths had been interfering with his business; he declared 
that he wasn't going to stand for it. 

Dr. Reid was attempting to mediate when a police sergeant 
arrived and asked the officers what was going on. One allegedly 
replied that they had been called in because "young nigger 
punks were disrupting deliveries to the stores." 

A dispute arose between Dr. Reid and the sergeant as to 
whether the officer had said "nigger." After further discussion 
the sergeant told the kids to "break it up!" Dr. Reid, together 
with some of the youngsters, returned to the Special Services 
Office. After talking to the youngsters again, Dr. Reid left to 
attend a meeting elsewhere. 

Soon after, some of the youngsters headed for the junior 
high school, where the meeting protesting the Frakes arrest 
and the anti-loitering ordinance was scheduled to take place. 

The police department, alerted to the possibility of a dis- 
turbance, mobilized. However, the police were wary of be- 
coming, as some Negro militants had complained, an inciting 
factor. Some months earlier, when Ku KJux Klansmen had 
been attracted to the scene of a speech by Stokely Carmichael, 
a Negro crowd, reacting to the heavy police patrolling, had 
gathered about the car of a plainclothesman and attempted to 
overturn it. On Monday, June 12, the department decided 
to withhold its men from the immediate area of the meeting. 

It appeared for a time as if this policy might be rewarded. 
Near the end of the rally, however, a Negro real estate broker 
arose to defend the police and the anti-loitering ordinance. 
The crowd, including the youngsters who had had the en- 

49 


counter with the police officers only a short time earlier, was 
incensed. When the meeting broke up, a missile was hurled 
through the window of a nearby church. A small fire was set 
in the street. A Molotov cocktail was thrown through the 
window of a drug store. 

The police were able to react quickly. There was only one 
major confrontation between them and the mob. Little re- 
sistance was offered. 

Although windows were broken in some two dozen stores, 
there was virtually no looting. There were 14 arrests, some 
unconnected with the disturbance. Among those arrested was 
a community worker, now studying for a doctorate at Brandeis 
University. When he went to the area to help get people off 
the streets, he was arrested and charged with loitering. 

The next morning a judge of the Municipal Court, before 
whom most of the persons charged were to be brought, said 
he intended to mete out the maximum sentence to anyone 
found guilty of a riot-connected offense. Although the judge 
later told the Commission that he knew his statement was a 
"violation of judicial ethics," he said that he made it because 
the "city was in a state of siege," and he intended it to act as 
a deterrent against further violence. 

Maximum sentences were, in fact, pronounced by the 
judge on all convicted in his court, regardless of the cir- 
cumstances of the arrest, or the background of the persons 
arrested. Police were charging most white persons arrested 
with disorderly conduct — for which the maximum sentence is 
30 days in jail and a $100 fine. Many Negroes, however, were 
charged with violation of the Riot Act — for which the maxi- 
mum sentence is one year in jail plus a $500 fine. Consequently, 
a major portion of the Negro community viewed this as an 
example of discriminatory justice. 

Tuesday morning Negro leaders presented a list of 11 de- 
mands and grievances stemming from the Monday night meet- 
ing to the municipal government. Included were demands for 
repeal of the anti-loitering law, release of all prisoners arrested 
during the disturbance, full employment for Negroes, and 
equal justice in the courts. 

Municipal officials agreed that the city council would con- 
sider the demands. However, they rejected a suggestion that 
they attend an open-air meeting of residents in the Avondale 
section. City leaders did not want to give stature to the mili- 
tants by recognizing them as the de facto representatives of 
the community. Yet, by all indications, the militants were the 
only persons with influence on the people on the streets. 

Mayor Walton H. Bachrach declared that he was "quite 
surprised" by the disturbance because the council had "worked 

50 


like hell" to help Negroes. Municipal officials, whose contacts 
were, as in other cities, generally with a few middle-class 
Negroes, appeared not to realize the volatile frustrations of 
Negroes in the ghetto. 

Early in the evening a crowd, consisting mostly of teenagers 
and young adults, began to gather in the Avondale District. 
When, after a short time, no one appeared to give direction, 
they began to mill about. A few minutes before 7:00 P.M. 
cars were stoned and windows were broken. Police moved in 
to disperse the gathering. 

Fires were set. When firemen reached the scene they were 
barraged with rocks and bottles. A full-scale confrontation 
took place between police riot squads and the Negro crowd. 
As police swept the streets, people scattered. According to the 
chief of police, at approximately 7:15, "All hell broke loose." 

The disorder leaped to other sections of the city. The con- 
fusion and rapidity with which it spread made it almost im- 
possible to determine its scope. 

Many reports of fires set by Molotov cocktails, cars being 
stoned, and windows being broken were received by the police. 
A white motorist — who died three weeks later — and a Negro 
sitting on his porch suffered gunshot wounds. Rumors spread 
of Negro gangs raiding white neighborhoods, of shootings, and 
of organization of the riot. Nearly all of them were determined 
later to be unfounded. 

At 9:40 P.M., following a request for aid to surrounding 
communities, Mayor Bachrach placed a call to the Governor 
asking for mobilization of the National Guard. 

At 2:30 A.M., Wednesday the first Guard units appeared 
on the streets. They followed a policy of restraint in the use of 
weapons. Few shots were fired. Two hours later, the streets 
were quiet. Most of the damage was minor. Of 40-odd fires 
reported before dawn, only 1 1 resulted in a loss of more than 
$1,000. The fire department log listed four as having caused 
major damage. 

That afternoon the city council held an open session. The 
chamber was jammed with Negro residents, many of whom 
gave vociferous support as their spokesmen criticized the city 
administration. When the audience became unruly, a detail 
of National Guardsmen was stationed outside the council 
chamber. Their presence resulted in a misunderstanding, caus- 
ing many of the Negroes to walk out, and the meeting to end. 

Wednesday night there were virtually no reports of riotous 
activity until 9:00 P.M., when scattered incidents of violence 
again began to take place. One person was injured by a gunshot. 

Despite fears of a clash between Negroes and SAMS — white 

51 


Southern Appalachian migrants whose economic conditions 
paralleled those of Negroes — such a clash was averted. 

H. "Rap" Brown, arriving in the city on Thursday, attempted 
to capitalize on the discontent by presenting a list of 20 "de- 
mands." Their principal effect would have been total removal 
of all white persons, whatever their capacity, from the ghetto 
area. Demand No. 18 stated that "at any meeting to settle 
grievances . . . any white proposal or white representative 
objected to by black representatives must be rejected auto- 
matically." No. 20 demanded a veto power over police officers 
patrolling the community. 

His appearance had no galvanizing effect. Although scat- 
tered incidents occurred for three days after the arrival of the 
National Guard, the disorder never returned to its early inten- 
sity. 

Of 63 reported injuries, 12 were serious enough to require 
hospitalization; 56 of the persons injured were white. Most 
of the injuries resulted from thrown objects and glass splinters. 
Of the 107 persons arrested Tuesday night, when the main 
disturbance took place, 75 were 21 years of age or younger. 
Of the total of 404 persons arrested, 128 were juveniles, and 
338 were 26 years of age or younger. Of the adults arrested, 
29 percent were unemployed. 

III. Atlanta 

On Saturday, June 17, as the National Guard was being 
withdrawn from Cincinnati, the same type of minor police 
arrest that had initiated the Cincinnati riot took place in At- 
lanta. 

Rapid industrialization following World War II, coupled 
with annexations that quadrupled the area of the city, had made 
Atlanta a vigorous and booming community. Pragmatic busi- 
ness and political leaders worked to give it a reputation as the 
moderate stronghold of the Deep South. 

Nevertheless, despite acceptance, in principle, of integration 
of schools and facilities, the fact that the city is headquarters 
both for civil rights organizations and segregationist elements 
created a strong and ever-present potential for conflict. 

The rapidly growing Negro population, which, by the sum- 
mer of 1967 had reached an estimated 44 percent, and was 
scattered in several ghettos throughout the city, was maintain- 
ing constant pressure on surrounding white residential areas. 
Some real estate agents engaged in "blockbusting tactics"2 to 

2 A block is considered to have been "busted" when one Negro family has 
been sold a home in a previously all-white area. 

52 


stimulate panic sales by white homeowners. The city police 
were continually on the alert to keep marches and counter- 
marches of civil rights and white supremacist organizations 
from flaring into violence. 

In September 1966, following a fatal shooting by a police 
officer of a Negro auto thief who was resisting arrest, only the 
dramatic ghetto appearance of Mayor Ivan Allen, Jr. had 
averted a riot. 

Boasting that Atlanta had the largest KKK membership in 
the country, the Klan, on June 4, 1967, marched through one 
of the poorer Negro sections. A massive police escort prevented 
a racial clash. 

According to Mayor Allen, 55 percent of municipal em- 
ployees hired in 1967 were Negroes, bringing their proportion 
of the city work force to 28 percent. Of 908 police department 
employees, 85 are Negro — a higher proportion of Negroes 
than in most major city police departments in the nation. 

To the Negro community, however, it appeared that the 
progress made served only to reduce the level of inequality. 
Equal conditions for blacks and whites remained a hope for 
the future. Different pay scales for black and white municipal 
employees performing the same jobs had been only recently 
eliminated. 

The economic and educational gap between the black and 
white populations may, in fact, have been increasing. The aver- 
age white Atlantan was a high school graduate; the average 
Negro Atlantan had not completed the eighth grade. 

In 1960 the median income of a Negro family was less than 
half of the white's $6,350 a year, and 48 percent of Negro 
families earned less than $3,000 a year. Fifty percent of the 
men worked in unskilled jobs, and many more Negro women 
than men, 7.9 percent as against 4.9 percent of the respective 
work forces, held well-paying, white collar jobs. 

Living on marginal incomes in cramped and deteriorating 
quarters — one-third of the housing was overcrowded and more 
than half substandard — families were breaking up at an in- 
creasing rate. In approximately four out of every 10 Negro 
homes the father was missing. In the case of families living in 
public housing projects, more than 60 percent are headed by 
females. 

Mayor Allen estimated there were 25,000 jobs in the city 
waiting to be filled because people lacked the education or 
skills to fill them. Yet overcrowding in many Negro schools 
forced the scheduling of extended and double sessions. Al- 
though Negroes comprised 60 percent of the school population, 
there were 14 "white" high schools compared to 9 Negro. 

The city has integrated its schools, but de facto segregation 

53 


as a result of housing patterns has had the effect of continuing 
separate schooling of nearly all white and Negro pupils. White 
high school students attended classes 6V1 hours a day; Negroes 
in high schools with double sessions attended AVi . 

One Atlanta newspaper continued to advertise jobs by race, 
and in some industrial plants there were "Negro" jobs and 
•'white" jobs, with little chance for advancement by Negroes. 

Shortly after 8:00 P.M. on Saturday, June 17, a young Ne- 
gro, E. W., carrying a can of beer, attempted to enter the Fla- 
mingo Grill in the Dixie Hills Shopping Center. When a Negro 
security guard told the youth he could not enter, a scuffle en- 
sued. Police officers were called to the guard's aid. E. W. re- 
ceived help from his 19-year-old sister, who flailed away at the 
officers with her purse. Another 19-year-old Negro youth en- 
tered the fray. All three were arrested. 

Although some 200 to 300 persons had been drawn to the 
scene of the incident, when police asked them to disperse, they 
complied. 

Because the area is isolated from the city in terms of trans- 
portation, and there are few recreational facilities, the shopping 
center is a natural gathering place. The next night, Sunday, an 
even bigger crowd was on hand. 

As they mingled, residents discussed their grievances. They 
were bitter about their inability to get the city government to 
correct conditions and make improvements. Garbage some- 
times was not picked up for two weeks in succession. Over- 
flowing garbage cans, littered streets, and cluttered empty lots 
were breeding grounds for rats. Inadequate storm drains led 
to flooded streets. Although residents had obtained title to 
several empty lots for use as playgrounds, the city failed to 
provide the equipment and men necessary to convert them. 

The area lacked a swimming pool. A nearby park was inac- 
cessible because of the lack of a road. Petitions submitted to 
the mayor's office for the correcting of these and other con- 
ditions were acknowledged, but not acted upon. 

Since only one of the 16 aldermen was a Negro, and a num- 
ber of black wards were represented by white aldermen, many 
Negroes felt they were not being properly represented on the 
city government. The small number of elected Negro officials 
appeared to be due to a system in which aldermen are elected 
at large, but represent specific wards, and must reside in the 
wards from which they are elected. Because of the quilted pat- 
tern of black-white housing, white candidates were able to 
meet the residency requirements for running from predomi- 
nantly Negro wards. Since, however, candidates are dependent 
upon the city-wide vote for election, and the city has a white 
majority, few Negroes had been able to attain office. 

54 


A decision was made by the Dixie Hills residents to organize 
committees and hold a protest meeting the next night. 

The headquarters of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
Committee (SNCC) is located in Atlanta. Its former president, 
Stokely Carmichael, wearing a green Malcolm X sweatshirt, 
appeared, together with several companions. Approaching a 
police captain, Carmichael asked why there were so many 
police cars in the area. Informed that they were there to make 
sure there was no disturbance, Carmichael, clapping his hands, 
declared in a sing-song voice that there might have to be a riot 
if the police cars were not removed. When Carmichael refused 
to move on as requested, he was arrested. 

Soon released on bail, the next morning Carmichael declared 
that the black people were preparing to resist "armed aggres- 
sion" by the police by whatever means necessary. 

Shortly thereafter in the Dixie Hills Shopping Center, which 
had been closed down for the day, a Negro youth, using a 
broom handle, began to pound on the outside bell of a burglar 
alarm that had been set off, apparently, by a short circuit. 
Police officers responded to the alarm and ordered him to 
stop hitting the bell. A scuffle ensued. Several bystanders 
intervened. One of the officers drew his service revolver and 
fired, superficially wounding the young man. 

Tension rose. Approximately 250 persons were present at 
that evening's meeting. When a number of Negro leaders urged 
the submission of a petition of grievances through legal chan- 
nels, the response was lukewarm. When Carmichael took to 
the podium, urging Negroes "to take to the streets and force 
the police department to work until they fall in their tracks," 
the response was tumultous. 

The press quoted him as saying: "It's not a question of 
law and order. We are not concerned with peace. We are 
concerned with the liberation of black people. We have to 
build a revolution." 

As the people present at the meeting poured into the street, 
they were joined by others. The crowd soon numbered an 
estimated 1,000. From alleys and rooftops rocks and bottles 
were thrown at the nine police officers on the scene. Windows 
of police cars were broken. Firecrackers exploded in the dark- 
ness. Police believe they may have been fired on. 

Reinforced by approximately 60 to 70 officers, the police, 
firing over the heads of the crowd, quickly regained control. 
Of the 10 persons arrested, six were 21 years of age or 
younger; only one was in his thirties. 

The next day city equipment appeared in the area to begin 
work on the long-delayed playgrounds and other projects de- 
manded by the citizens. It was announced that a Negro Youth 

55 


Patrol would be established along the lines of the Tampa White 
Hats. 

SNCC responded that volunteers for the patrol would be 
selling their "Black brothers out," and would be viewed as 
"Black Traitors," to be dealt with in the "manner we see 
fit." Nevertheless, during the course of the summer the 200 
youths participating in the corps played an important role 
in preventing a serious outbreak. The police believe that 
establishment of the youth corps became a major factor in 
improving police-community relations. 

Another meeting of area residents was called for Tuesday 
evening. At its conclusion 200 protesters were met by 300 
police officers. As two police officers chased several boys 
down the street, a cherry bomb or incendiary device exploded 
at the officers' feet. In response, several shots were fired 
from a group of police consisting mostly of Negro officers. 
The discharge from a shotgun struck in the midst of several 
persons sitting on the front porch of a house. A 46-year old 
man was killed; a 9-year old boy was critically injured. 

Because of the efforts of neighborhood and anti-poverty 
workers who circulated through the area, and the later appear- 
ance of Mayor Allen, no further violence ensued. 

When H. "Rap" Brown, who had returned to the city that 
afternoon, went to other Negro areas in an attempt to initiate 
a demonstration against the shooting of the Negroes on the 
porch, he met with no response. 

Within the next few days a petition was drawn up by State 
Senator Leroy Johnson and other moderate Negro leaders 
demanding that Stokely Carmichael get out of the community 
and allow the people to handle their own affairs. It was signed 
by more than 1,000 persons in the Dixie Hills area. 

IV. Newark 

The last outburst in Atlanta occurred on Tuesday night, 
June 20. That same night, in Newark, New Jersey, a tumultu- 
ous meeting of the Planning Board took place. Until 4 A.M., 
speaker after speaker from the Negro ghetto arose to denounce 
the city's intent to turn over 150 acres in the heart of the 
Central Ward as a site for the state's new medical and dental 
college. 

The growing opposition to the city administration by vocal 
black residents had paralyzed both the Planning Board and 
the Board of Education. Tension had been rising so steadily 
throughout the northern New Jersey area that, in the first 
week of June, Colonel David Kelly, head of the state police, 
had met with municipal police chiefs to draw up plans for 

56 


state police support of city police wherever a riot developed. 
Nowhere was the tension greater than in Newark. 

Founded in 1666, the city, part of the Greater New York 
City port complex, rises from the salt marshes of the Passaic 
River. Although in 1967 Newark's population of 400,000 
still ranked it thirtieth among American municipalities, for 
the past 20 years the white middle class had been deserting 
the city for the suburbs. 

In the late 1950's the desertions had become a rout. Be- 
tween 1960 and 1967, the city lost a net total of more than 
70,000 white residents. Replacing them in vast areas of dilapi- 
dated housing where living conditions, according to a promi- 
nent member of the County Bar Association, were so bad that 
"people would be kinder to their pets," were Negro migrants, 
Cubans and Puerto Ricans. In six years the city switched 
from 65 percent white to 52 percent Negro and 10 percent 
Puerto Rican and Cuban. 

The white population, nevertheless, retained political control 
of the city. On both the City Council and the Board of Edu- 
cation seven of nine members were white. On other key 
boards the disparity was equal or greater. In the Central Ward, 
where the medical college controversy raged, the Negro con- 
stituents and their white councilman found themselves on 
opposite sides of almost every crucial issue. 

The municipal administration lacked the ability to respond 
quickly enough to navigate the swiftly changing currents. 
Even had it had great astuteness, it would have lacked the 
financial resources to affect significantly the course of events. 

In 1962, seven-term Congressman Hugh Addonizio had 
forged an Italian-Negro coalition to overthrow long-time Irish 
control of the City Hall. A liberal in Congress, Addonizio, 
when he became mayor, had opened his door to all people. 
Negroes, who had been excluded from the previous admin- 
istration, were brought into the government. The police de- 
partment was integrated. 

Nevertheless, progress was slow. As the Negro population 
increased, more and more of the politically oriented found 
the progress inadequate. 

The Negro-Italian coalition began to develop strains over 
the issue of the police. The police were largely Italian, the 
persons they arrested largely Negro. Community leaders agreed 
that, as in many police forces, there was a small minority of 
officers who abused their responsibility. This gave credibility 
to the cries of "Brutality!" voiced periodically by ghetto 
Negroes. 

In 1965 Mayor Addonizio, acknowledged that there was 
"a small group of misguided individuals" in the department, 

57 


declared that "it is vital to establish once and for all, in the 
minds of the public, that charges of alleged police brutality 
will be thoroughly investigated and the appropriate legal or 
punitive action be taken if the charges are found to be sub- 
stantiated." 

Pulled one way by the Negro citizens who wanted a Police 
Review Board, and the other by the police, who adamantly 
opposed it, the mayor decided to transfer "the control and 
investigation of complaints of police brutality out of the hands 
of both the police and the public and into the hands of an 
agency that all can support — the Federal Bureau of Investi- 
gation;" and to send "a copy of any charge of police brutality 
. . . directly to the Prosecutor's office." However, the FBI 
could act only if there had been a violation of a person's 
federal civil rights. No complaint was ever heard of again. 

Nor was there much redress for other complaints. The city 
had no money with which to redress them. 

The city had already reached its legal bonding limit, yet 
expenditures continued to outstrip income. Health and welfare 
costs, per capita, were 20 times as great as for some of the 
surrounding communities. Cramped by its small land area of 
23.6 square miles— one-third of which was taken up by New- 
ark Airport and unusable marshland — and surrounded by in- 
dependent jurisdictions, the city had nowhere to expand. 

Taxable property was contracting as land, cleared for urban 
renewal, lay fallow year after year. Property taxes had been 
increased, perhaps, to the point of diminishing return. By 
the fall of 1967 they were to reach $661.70 on a $10,000 
house — double that of suburban communities.3 As a result, 
people were refusing either to own or to renovate property 
in the city. Seventy-four percent of white and 87 percent of 
Negro families lived in rental housing. Whoever was able to 
move to the suburbs, moved. Many of these persons, as down- 
town areas were cleared and new office buildings were con- 
structed, continued to work in the city. Among them were 
a large proportion of the people from whom a city normally 
draws its civic leaders, but who, after moving out, tended to 
cease involving themselves in the community's problems. 

During the daytime Newark more than doubled its popu- 
lation— and was, therefore, forced to provide services for a 
large number of people who contributed nothing in property 
taxes. The city's per capita outlay for police, fire protection 
and other municipal services continued to increase. By 1967 
it was twice that of the surrounding area. 

3 The legal tax rate is $7.76 per $100 of market value. However, because of 
inflation, a guideline of 85.27 percent of market value is used in assessing, 
reducing the true tax rate to $6,617 per $100. 

58 


Consequently, there was less money to spend on education. 
Newark's per capita outlay on schools was considerably less 
than that of surrounding communities. Yet within the city's 
school system were 78,000 children, 14,000 more than 10 
years earlier. 

Twenty thousand pupils were on double sessions. The drop- 
out rate was estimated to be as high as 33 percent. Of 13,600 
Negroes between the ages of 16 and 19, more than 6,000 were 
not in school. In 1960 over half of the adult Negro population 
had less than an eighth grade education. 

The typical ghetto cycle of high unemployment, family 
breakup, and crime was present in all its elements. Approxi- 
mately 12 percent of Negroes were without jobs. An esti- 
mated 40 percent of Negro children lived in broken homes. 
Although Newark maintained proportionately the largest po- 
lice force of any major city, its crime rate was among the 
highest in the nation. In narcotics violations it ranked fifth 
nationally. Almost 80 percent of the crimes were committed 
within two miles of the core of the city, where the Central 
Ward is located. A majority of the criminals were Negro. 
Most of the victims, likewise, were Negro. The Mafia was 
reputed to control much of the organized crime. 

Under such conditions a major segment of the Negro popu- 
lation became increasingly militant. Largely excluded from 
positions of traditional political power, Negroes, tutored by a 
handful of militant social activists who had moved into the 
city in the early 1960's, made use of the anti-poverty pro- 
gram, in which poor people were guaranteed representation, 
as a political springboard. This led to friction between the 
United Community Corporation, the agency that administered 
the anti-poverty program, and the city administration. 

When it became known that the secretary of the Board of 
Education intended to retire, the militants proposed for the 
position the city's budget director, a Negro with a master's de- 
gree in accounting. The mayor, however, had already nomi- 
nated a white man. Since the white man had only a high school 
education, and at least 70 percent of the children in the school 
system were Negro, the issue of who was to obtain the secre- 
taryship, an important and powerful position, quickly became 
a focal issue. 

Joined with the issue of the 150-acre medical school site, 
the area of which had been expanded to triple the original re- 
quest— an expansion regarded by the militants as an effort to 
dilute the black political power by moving out Negro residents 
— the Board of Education battle resulted in a confrontation be- 
tween the mayor and the militants. Both sides refused to alter 
their positions. 

59 


Into this impasse stepped a Washington Negro named Albert 
Roy Osborne. A flamboyant, 42-year-old former wig salesman 
who called himself Colonel Hassan Jem-Ahmed and wore a 
black beret, he presided over a mythical "Blackman's Volun- 
teer Army of Liberation." Articulate and magnetic, the self- 
commissioned "Colonel" proved to be a one-man show. He 
brought Negro residents flocking to Board of Education and 
Planning Board meetings. The Colonel spoke in violent terms, 
and backed his words with violent action. At one meeting he 
tore the tape from the official stenographic recorder. 

It became more and more evident to the militants that, 
though they might not be able to prevail, they could prevent 
the normal transaction of business. Filibustering began. A Ne- 
gro former state assemblyman held the floor for more than four 
hours. One meeting of the Board of Education began at 5:00 
P.M. and did not adjourn until 3:23 A.M. Throughout the 
months of May and June speaker after speaker warned that if 
the mayor persisted in naming a white man as Secretary to the 
Board of Education, and in moving ahead with plans for the 
medical school site, violence would ensue. The city admini- 
stration played down the threats. 

On June 27th, when a new secretary to the Board of Educa- 
tion was to be named, the state police set up a command post 
in the Newark armory. 

The militants, led by the local CORE (Congress of Racial 
Equality) chapter, disrupted and took over the Board of Edu- 
cation meeting. The outcome was a stalemate. The incumbent 
secretary decided to stay on another year. No one was satisfied. 

At the beginning of July there were 24,000 unemployed 
Negroes within the city limits. Their ranks were swelled by an 
estimated 20,000 teenagers, many of whom, with school out 
and the summer recreation program curtailed due to a lack of 
funds, had no place to go. 

On July 8, Newark and East Orange Police attempted to 
disperse a group of Black Muslims. In the melee that followed, 
several police officers and Muslims suffered injuries necessi- 
tating medical treatment. The resulting charges and counter- 
charges heightened the tension between police and Negroes. 

Early on the evening of July 12, a cab driver named John 
Smith began, according to police reports, tailgating a Newark 
police car. Smith was an unlikely candidate to set a riot in mo- 
tion. Forty years old, a Georgian by birth, he had attended 
college for a year before entering the Army in 1950. In 1953 
he had been honorably discharged with the rank of corporal. A 
chess-playing trumpet player, he had worked as a musician 
and a factory hand before, in 1963, becoming a cab driver. 

60 


As a cab driver, he appeared to be a hazard. Within a rela- 
tively short period of time he had eight or nine accidents. His 
license was revoked. When, with a woman passenger in his 
cab, he was stopped by the police, he was in violation of that 
revocation. 

From the high-rise towers of the Reverend William P. Hayes 
Housing Project, the residents can look down on the orange- 
red brick facade of the Fourth Precinct Police Station and 
observe every movement. Shortly after 9:30 P.M., people saw 
Smith, who either refused or was unable to walk, being 
dragged out of a police car and into the front door of the 
station. 

Within a few minutes at least two civil rights leaders re- 
ceived calls from a hysterical woman declaring a cab driver 
was being beaten by the police. When one of the persons at the 
station notified the cab company of Smith's arrest, cab drivers 
all over the city began learning of it over their cab radios. 

A crowd formed on the grounds of the housing project across 
the narrow street from the station. As more and more people 
arrived, the description of the beating purportedly administered 
to Smith became more and more exaggerated. The descriptions 
were supported by other complaints of police malpractice 
that, over the years, had been submitted for investigation — 
but had never been heard of again. 

Several Negro community leaders, telephoned by a civil 
rights worker and informed of the deteriorating situation, 
rushed to the scene. By 10:15 P.M. the atmosphere had be- 
come so potentially explosive that Kenneth Melchior, the 
senior police inspector on the night watch, was called. He 
arrived at approximately 10:30 P.M. 

Met by a delegation of civil rights leaders and militants who 
requested the right to see and interview Smith, Inspector Mel- 
chior acceded to their request. 

When the delegation was taken to Smith, Melchior agreed 
with their observations that, as a result of injuries Smith had 
suffered, he needed to be examined by a doctor. Arrangements 
were made to have a police car transport him to the hospital. 

Both within and outside of the police station the atmosphere 
was electric with hostility. Carloads of police officers arriving 
for the 10:45 P.M. change of shifts were subjected to a gaunt- 
let of catcalls, taunts and curses. 

Joined by Oliver Lofton, administrative director of the New- 
ark Legal Services Project, the Negro community leaders in- 
side the station requested an interview with Inspector Melchior. 
As they were talking to the inspector about initiating an in- 
vestigation to determine how Smith had been injured, the 

61 


crowd outside became more and more unruly. Two of the 
Negro spokesmen went outside to attempt to pacify the people. 
There was little reaction to the spokesmen's appeal that the 
people go home. The second of the two had just finished speak- 
ing from atop a car when several Molotov cocktails smashed 
against the wall of the police station. 

With the call of "Fire!" most of those inside the station, 
police officers and civilians alike, rushed out of the front door. 
The Molotov cocktails had splattered to the ground; the fire 
was quickly extinguished. 

Inspector Melchior had a squad of men form a line across 
the front of the station. The police officers and the Negroes 
on the other side of the street exchanged volleys of profanity. 

Three of the Negro leaders, Timothy Still of the United 
Community Corporation, Robert Curvin of CORE, and Lofton, 
requested they be given another opportunity to disperse the 
crowd. Inspector Melchior agreed to let them try, and provided 
a bullhorn. It was apparent that the several hundred persons 
who had gathered in the street and on the grounds of the hous- 
ing project were not going to disperse. Therefore, it was de- 
cided to attempt to channel the energies of the people into a 
nonviolent protest. While Lofton promised the crowd that a full 
investigation would be made of the Smith incident, the other 
Negro leaders urged those on the scene to form a line of march 
toward the city hall. 

Some persons joined the line of march. Others milled about 
in the narrow street. From the dark grounds of the housing 
project came a barrage of rocks. Some of them fell among the 
crowd. Others hit persons in the line of march. Many smashed 
the windows of the police station. The rock throwing, it was 
believed, was the work of youngsters; approximately 2,500 
children lived in the housing project. 

Almost at the same time, an old car was set afire in a park- 
ing lot. The line of march began to disintegrate. The police, 
their heads protected by World War I-type helmets, sallied 
forth to disperse the crowd. A fire engine, arriving on the scene, 
was pelted with rocks. As police drove people away from the 
station, they scattered in all directions. 

A few minutes later a nearby liquor store was broken into. 
Some persons, seeing a caravan of cabs appear at city hall to 
protest Smith's arrest, interpreted this as evidence that the dis- 
turbance had been organized, and generated rumors to that 
effect. 

However, only a few stores were looted. Within a short 
period of time the disorder ran its course. 

The next afternoon, Thursday, July 13, the mayor described 
it as an isolated incident. At a meeting with Negro leaders to 

62 


discuss measures to defuse the situation, he agreed to appoint 
the first Negro police captain, and announced that he would 
set up a panel of citizens to investigate the Smith arrest. To one 
civil rights leader this sounded like"the playback of a record," 
and he walked out. Other observers reported that the mayor 
seemed unaware of the seriousness of the tensions. 

The police were not. Unknown to the mayor, Dominick 
Spina, the director of police, had extended shifts from eight 
hours to 12, and was in the process of mobilizing half the 
strength of the department for that evening. The night before, 
Spina had arrived at the Fourth Precinct Police Station at 
approximately midnight, and had witnessed the latter half of 
the disturbance. Earlier in the evening he had held the regular 
weekly "open house" in his office. This was intended to give 
any person who wanted to talk to him an opportunity to do 
so. Not a single person had shown up. 

As director of police, Spina had initiated many new pro- 
grams: police-precinct councils, composed of the police 
precinct captain and business and civic leaders, who would 
meet once a month to discuss mutual problems; Junior Crime- 
fighters; a Boy Scout Explorer program for each precinct; 
mandatory human relations training for every officer; a 
Citizens' Observer Program, which permitted citizens to ride 
in police cars and observe activities in the stations; a Police 
Cadet program; and others. 

Many of the programs initially had been received enthu- 
siastically, but — as was the case with the "open house" — 
interest had fallen off. In general, the programs failed to reach 
the hard-core unemployed, the disaffected, the school dropouts 
— of whom Spina estimates there are 10,000 in Essex County 
— that constitute a major portion of the police problem. 

Reports and rumors, including one that Smith had died, 
circulated through the Negro community. Tension continued 
to rise. Nowhere was the tension greater than at the Spirit 
House, the gathering place for Black Nationalists, Black Power 
advocates, and militants of every hue. Black Muslims, Ortho- 
dox Muslims, and members of the United Afro-American 
Association, a new and growing organization that follows, in 
general, the teachings of the late Malcolm X, came regularly 
to mingle and exchange views. Anti-white playwright LeRoi 
Jones held workshops. The two police-Negro clashes, coming 
one on top of the other, coupled with the unresolved political 
issues, had created a state of crisis. 

On Thursday, inflammatory leaflets were circulated in the 
neighborhoods of the Fourth Precinct. A "Police Brutality Pro- 
test Rally" was announced for early evening in front of the 
Fourth Precinct Station. Several television stations and news- 

63 


papers sent news teams to interview people. Cameras were set 
up. A crowd gathered. 

A picket line was formed to march in front of the police 
station. Between 7:00 and 7:30 P.M. James Threatt, Execu- 
tive Director of the Newark Human Rights Commission, 
arrived to announce to the people the decision of the mayor to 
form a citizens group to investigate the Smith incident, and to 
elevate a Negro to the rank of captain. 

The response from the loosely milling mass of people was 
derisive. One youngster shouted "Black Power!" Rocks were 
thrown at Threatt, a Negro. The barrage of missiles that fol- 
lowed placed the police station under siege. 

After the barrage had continued for some minutes, police 
came out to disperse the crowd. According to witnesses, there 
was little restraint of language or action by either side. A 
number of police officers and Negroes were injured. 

As on the night before, once the people had been dispersed, 
reports of looting began to come in. Soon the glow of the first 
fire was seen. 

Without enough men to establish control, the police set up 
a perimeter around a two-mile stretch of Springfield Avenue, 
one of the principal business districts, where bands of youths 
roamed up and down smashing windows. Grocery and liquor 
stores, clothing and furniture stores, drug stores and cleaners, 
appliance stores and pawnshops were the principal targets. 
Periodically police officers would appear and fire their weapons 
over the heads of looters and rioters. Laden with stolen goods, 
people began returning to the housing projects. 

Near midnight, activity appeared to taper off. The Mayor 
told reporters the city had turned the corner. 

As news of the disturbance had spread, however, people had 
flocked into the streets. As they saw stores being broken into 
with impunity, many bowed to temptation and joined the 
looting. 

Without the necessary personnel to make mass arrests, police 
were shooting into the air to clear stores. A Negro boy was 
wounded by a .22 caliber bullet said to have been fired by a 
white man riding in a car. Guns were reported stolen from a 
Sears, Roebuck store. Looting, fires, and gunshots were re- 
ported from a widening area. Between 2:00 and 2:30 A.M. on 
Friday, July 14, the mayor decided to request Governor 
Richard J. Hughes to dispatch the state police, and National 
Guard troops. The first elements of the state police arrived 
with a sizeable contingent before dawn. 

During the morning the governor and the mayor, together 
with police and National Guard officers, made a reconnais- 
sance of the area. The police escort guarding the officials ar- 

64 


rested looters as they went. By early afternoon the National 
Guard had set up 137 roadblocks, and state police and riot 
teams were beginning to achieve control. Command of anti- 
riot operations was taken over by the governor, who decreed a 
"hard line" in putting down the riot. 

As a result of technical difficulties, such as the fact that the 
city and state police did not operate on the same radio wave- 
lengths, the three-way command structure — city police, state 
police and National Guard — worked poorly. 

At 3:30 P.M. that afternoon, the family of Mrs. D. J. was 
standing near the upstairs windows of their apartment, watch- 
ing looters run in and out of a furniture store on Springfield 
Avenue. Three carloads of police rounded the corner. As the 
police yelled at the looters, they began running. 

The police officers opened fire. A bullet smashed the kitchen 
window in Mrs. D. J.'s apartment. A moment later she heard 
a cry from the bedroom. Her 3 -year old daughter, Debbie, 
came running into the room. Blood was streaming down the 
left side of her face: the bullet had entered her eye. The child 
spent the next two months in the hospital. She lost the sight 
of her left eye and the hearing in her left ear. 

Simultaneously, on the street below, Horace W. Morris, an 
associate director of the Washington Urban League who had 
been visiting relatives in Newark, was about to enter a car for 
the drive to Newark Airport. With him were his two brothers 
and his 73-year old step-father, Isaac Harrison. About 60 
persons had been on the street watching the looting. As the 
police arrived, three of the looters cut directly in front of the 
group of spectators. The police fired at the looters. Bullets 
plowed into the spectators. Everyone began running. As Harri- 
son, followed by the family, headed toward the apartment 
building in which he lived, a bullet kicked his legs out from 
under him. Horace Morris lifted him to his feet. Again he fell. 
Mr. Morris' brother, Virgil, attempted to pick the old man up. 
As he was doing so, he was hit in the left leg and right fore- 
arm. Mr. Morris and his other brother managed to drag the 
two wounded men into the vestibule of the building, jammed 
with 60 to 70 frightened, angry Negroes. 

Bullets continued to spatter against the walls of the build- 
ings. Finally, as the firing died down, Morris — whose step- 
father died that evening — yelled to a sergeant that innocent 
people were being shot. 

"Tell the black bastards to stop shooting at us," the sergeant, 
according to Morris, replied. 

"They don't have guns; no one is shooting at you," Morris 
said. 

65 


"You shut up, there's a sniper on the roof," the sergeant 
yelled. 

A short time later, at approximately 5:00 P.M., in the same 
vicinity a police detective was killed by a small caliber bullet. 
The origin of the shot could not be determined. Later during 
the riot a fireman was killed by a .30 caliber bullet. Snipers 
were blamed for the deaths of both. 

At 5:30 P.M., on Beacon Street, W. F. told J. S., whose 1959 
Pontiac he had taken to the station for inspection, that his 
front brake needed fixing. J. S., who had just returned from 
work, went to the car which was parked in the street, jacked up 
the front end, took the wheel off and got under the car. 

The street was quiet. More than a dozen persons were sitting 
on porches, walking about, or shopping. None heard any shots. 
Suddenly several state troopers appeared at the corner of 
Springfield and Beacon. J. S. was startled by a shot clanging 
into the side of the garbage can next to his car. As he looked 
up he saw a state trooper with his rifle pointed at him. The next 
shot struck him in the right side. 

At almost the same instant, K. G., standing on a porch, was 
struck in the right eye by a bullet. Both he and J. S. were 
critically injured. 

At 8:00 P.M., Mrs. L. M. bundled her husband, her hus- 
band's brother, and her four sons into the family car to drive 
to a restaurant for dinner. On the return trip her husband, who 
was driving, panicked as he approached a National Guard 
roadblock. He slowed the car, then quickly swerved around. 
A shot rang out. When the family reached home, everyone 
began piling out of the car. Ten-year-old Eddie failed to move. 
Shot through the head, he was dead. 

Although, by nightfall, most of the looting and burning 
had ended, reports of sniper fire increased. The fire was, ac- 
cording to New Jersey National Guard reports, "deliberately or 
otherwise inaccurate." Major General James F. Cantwell, 
Chief of Staff of the New Jersey National Guard, testified 
before an Armed Services Subcommittee of the House of 
Representatives that "there was too much firing initially against 
snipers" because of "confusion when we were finally called on 
for help and our thinking of it as a military action." 

"As a matter of fact," Director of Police Spina told the 
Commission, "down in the Springfield Avenue area it was so 
bad that, in my opinion, Guardsmen were firing upon police 
and police were firing back at them ... I really don't believe 
there was as much sniping as we thought . . . We have since 
compiled statistics indicating that there were 79 specified 
instances of sniping." 

Several problems contributed to the misconceptions regard- 

66 


ing snipers: the lack of communications; the fact that one shot 
might be reported half a dozen times by half a dozen different 
persons as it caromed and reverberated a mile or more through 
the city; the fact that the National Guard troops lacked riot 
training. They were, said a police official, "young and very 
scared," and had had little contact with Negroes. 

Within the Guard itself contact with Negroes had certainly 
been limited. Although, in 1949, out of a force of 12,529 
men there had been 1,183 Negroes, following the integration of 
the Guard in the 1950's the number had declined until, by 
July of 1967, there were 303 Negroes in a force of 17,529 
men. 

On Saturday, July 15, Spina received a report of snipers in 
a housing project. When he arrived he saw approximately 100 
National Guardsmen and police officers crouching behind 
vehicles, hiding in corners and lying on the ground around 
the edge of the courtyard. 

Since everything appeared quiet and it was broad daylight, 
Spina walked directly down the middle of the street. Nothing 
happened. As he came to the last building of the complex, he 
heard a shot. All around him the troopers jumped, believing 
themselves to be under sniper fire. A moment later a young 
Guardsman ran from behind a building. 

The director of police went over and asked him if he had 
fired the shot. The soldier said yes, he had fired to scare a man 
away from a window; that his orders were to keep everyone 
away from windows. 

Spina said he told the soldier: "Do you know what you just 
did? You have now created a state of hysteria. Every Guards- 
man up and down this street and every State Policeman and 
every city policeman that is present thinks that somebody just 
fired a shot and that it is probably a sniper." 

A short time later more "gunshots" were heard. Investigat- 
ing, Spina came upon a Puerto Rican sitting on a wall. In reply 
to a question as to whether he knew "where the firing is coming 
from?" the man said: 

"That's no firing. That's fireworks. If you look up to the 
fourth floor, you will see the people who are throwing down 
these cherry bombs." 

By this time four truckloads of National Guardsmen had 
arrived and troopers and policemen were again crouched every- 
where, looking for a sniper. The director of police remained 
at the scene for three hours, and the only shot fired was the one 
by the Guardsman. 

Nevertheless, at six o'clock that evening two columns of 
National Guardsmen and state troopers were directing mass 

67 


fire at the Hayes Housing Project in response to what they 
believed were snipers. 

On the tenth floor, Eloise Spellman, the mother of several 
children, fell, a bullet through her neck. 

Across the street a number of persons, standing in an apart- 
ment window, were watching the firing directed at the housing 
project. Suddenly several troopers whirled and began firing in 
the general direction of the spectators. Mrs. Hattie Gainer, a 
grandmother, sank to the floor. 

A block away Rebecca Brown's 2-year old daughter was 
standing at the window. Mrs. Brown rushed to drag her to 
safety. As Mrs. Brown was, momentarily, framed in the win- 
dow, a bullet spun into her back. 

All three women died. 

A number of eye witnesses, at varying times and places, 
reported seeing bottles thrown from upper story windows. As 
these would land at the feet of an officer he would turn and fire. 
Thereupon, other officers and Guardsmen up and down the 
street would join in. 

In order to protect his property, B. W. W., the owner of a 
Chinese laundry, had placed a sign saying "Soul Brother" in 
his window. Between 1:00 and 1:30 A.M., on Sunday, July 
16, he, his mother, wife, and brother, were watching television 
in the back room. The neighborhood had been quiet. Suddenly 
B. W. W. heard the sound of jeeps, then shots. 

Going to an upstairs window he was able to look out into 
the street. There he observed several jeeps, from which soldiers 
and state troopers were firing into stores that had "Soul 
Brother" signs in the windows. During the course of three 
nights, according to dozens of eye witness reports, law en- 
forcement officers shot into and smashed windows of busi- 
nesses that contained signs indicating they were Negro owned. 

At 11.00 P.M., on Sunday, July 16th, Mrs. Lucille Pugh 
looked out of the window to see if the streets were clear. 
She then asked her 11 -year-old son, Michael, to take the 
garbage out. As he reached the street and was illuminated by 
a street light, a shot rang out. He died. 

By Monday afternoon, July 17, state police and National 
Guard forces were withdrawn. That evening, a Catholic priest 
saw two Negro men walking down the street. They were 
carrying a case of soda and two bags of groceries. An un- 
marked car with five police officers pulled up beside them. 
Two white officers got out of the car. Accusing the Negro 
men of looting, the officers made them put the groceries on 
the sidewalk, then kicked the bags open, scattering their con- 
tents all over the street. 

Telling the men, "Get out of here," the officers drove off. 

68 


The Catholic priest went across the street to help gather up 
the groceries. One of the men turned to him: "I've just been 
back from Vietnam two days," he said, "and this is what I 
get. I feel like going home and getting a rifle and shooting 
the cops." 

Of the 250 fire alarms, many had been false, and 13 were 
considered by the city to have been "serious." Of the $10,- 
251,000 damage total, four-fifths was due to stock loss. 
Damage to buildings and fixtures was less than $2 million. 

Twenty-three persons were killed — a white detective, a white 
fireman, and 21 Negroes. One was 73-year-old Isaac Harrison. 
Six were women. Two were children. 

V.  Northern New Jersey 

Reports of looting, sniping, fire and death in Newark wove 
a web of tension over other Negro enclaves in northern New 
Jersey. Wherever Negro ghettos existed — Elizabeth, Engle- 
wood, Jersey City, Plainfield, New Brunswick — people had 
friends and relatives living in Newark. Everywhere the tele- 
phone provided a direct link to the scenes of violence. The 
telephoned messages frequently were at variance with reports 
transmitted by the mass media. 

As reports of the excessive use of firearms in Newark grew, 
so did fear and anger in the Negro ghettos. Conversely, rumors 
amplified by radio, television and the newspapers — especially 
with regard to guerrilla bands roaming the streets — created 
a sense of danger and terror within the white communities. 
To Mayor Patricia Q. Sheehan of New Brunswick, it seemed 
"almost as if there was a fever in the air." She went on to 
say: "Rumors were coming in from all sides on July 17th. 
Negroes were calling to warn of possible disturbances; whites 
were calling; shop owners were calling. Most of the people 
were concerned about a possible bloodbath." 

Her opinion was:  "We are talking ourselves into it." 

Everywhere there was the same inequality with regard to 
education, job opportunities, income, and housing. Every- 
where, partly because the Negro population was younger than 
the white, Negroes were under-represented on the local gov- 
ernment. In six New Jersey communities4 with sizeable Negro 
populations, of a total of 50 councilmen, six were Negro. 
In a half-dozen school systems in which Negro children com- 
prised as much as half of the school population, of a total 
of 42 members on boards of education, seven were Negro. 

In each of the ghettos the Negro felt himself surrounded 
by an intransigent wall of whites. In four suburban cities — 

* Jersey City, Elizabeth,  Englewood, Plainfield, Paterson, New Brunswick. 

69 


Bloomfield, Harrison, Irvington, and Maplewood — forming an 
arc about Newark, out of a total population of more than 
150,000, only 1,000 were Negroes. In the six cities surround- 
ing Plainfield, out of a population of more than 75,000, only 
1,500 were Negro. 

Three northern New Jersey communities, Jersey City, Pat- 
erson, and Elizabeth, had had disorders in previous years, 
the first two in 1964, Elizabeth in both 1964 and 1965. In 
general, these seem to have developed from resentment against 
the police. The most serious outbreak had occurred in Jersey 
City after police had arrested a woman, and a rumor cir- 
culated that the woman had been beaten. 

As early as May, 1967, the authorities in Jersey City and 
Elizabeth had started receiving warnings of trouble in the 
summer ahead. Following the Newark outbreak, rumors and 
reports, as in New Brunswick, became rampant. The police, 
relying on past experiences, were in no mood to take chances. 
In both Jersey City and Elizabeth patrols were augmented, 
and the departments were placed in a state of alert. 

The view from Jersey City is that of the New York skyline. 
Except for a few imposing buildings, such as the high-rise 
New Jersey Medical Center, much of the city is a collection 
of factories and deteriorating houses, cut up by ribbons of 
super-highways and railroads. 

As one of the principal freight terminals for New York 
City, Jersey City's decline has paralleled that of the railroads. 
As railroad lands deteriorated in value and urban renewal 
lands were taken off the tax rolls, assessed valuation plum- 
meted from $464 million in 1964 to $367 million in 1967. 
The tax rate, according to Mayor Thomas J. Whelan, has 
"reached the point of diminishing returns." 

Urban renewal projects, which were intended to clear slums 
and replace them with low-cost housing, in fact, resulted in 
a reduction of 2,000 housing units. On one area, designated 
for urban renewal six years before, no work had been done, 
and it remained as blighted in 1967 as it had been in 1961. 
Ramshackle houses deteriorated, no repairs were made, yet 
people continued to inhabit them. "Planners make plans and 
then simply tell people what they are going to do," Negroes 
complained in their growing opposition to such projects. 

Wooden sewers serve residents of some sections of the city. 
Collapsing brick sewers in other sections back up the sewage. 
The population clamors for better education, but the school 
system has reached its bonding capacity. By 1975 it is esti- 
mated that there will be a net deficit of 10 elementary schools 
and one high school. 

Recently the mayor proposed to the Ford Foundation that 

70 


it take over the operation of the entire educational system. 
The offer was declined. 

Many whites send their children to parochial schools. Pos- 
sibly as a result, white residents have been slower to move 
to the suburbs than in other cities. 

The exodus, however, is accelerating. Within the past 10 
years the Negro population has almost doubled, and now 
comprises an estimated 20 percent of the total. The little 
Negro political leadership that exists is fragmented and in- 
decisive. The county in which Jersey City is located is run 
by an old-line political machine that has given Negroes little 
opportunity for participation. 

Although the amount of schooling whites and Negroes have 
had is almost equal, in 1960 the median family income of 
whites was $1,500 more than that of Negroes. 

The police department, like Newark's, one of the largest 
in the nation for a city of its size, has a reputation for tough- 
ness. A successful white executive recalled that in his child- 
hood: "We were accustomed to the Special Service Division 
of the Police Department. If we were caught hanging around 
we were picked up by the police, taken to a nearby precinct, 
and beaten with a rubber hose." 

A city official, questioned about Negro representation on 
the 825-man police force, replied that it was 34 times greater 
than 20 years ago. Twenty years ago it had consisted of one 
man. 

During the four days of the Newark riot, when Jersey City 
was flooded with tales of all description, Mayor Whelan an- 
nounced that if there were any disturbances he would "meet 
force with force." The ghetto area was saturated with police 
officers. 

On Monday and Tuesday, July 17 and 18, when crowds 
gathered and a few rocks were thrown, mass arrests were 
made. Only one store was broken into, and pilferage was 
limited to items such as candy and chewing gum. 

One man died. He was a Negro passenger in a cab into 
which a Negro boy threw a Molotov cocktail. 

In Elizabeth, as in Jersey City, police had beefed up their 
patrols, and the very presence of so many officers contributed 
to the rising tensions. Residents of the 12-block by 3-block 
ghetto, jammed between the New Jersey Turnpike and the 
waterfront, expressed the opinion that: "We are being pun- 
ished but we haven't done anything." 

"The community," another said later, "felt it was in a 
concentration camp." 

Youths from the two high-density housing projects concen- 

71 


trated in the area were walking around saying: "We're next, 
we might as well go." 

Between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m. Monday, July 17, a window 
was broken in a drugstore across the street from a housing 
project. A businessman commented: "Down here in the port 
it's business as usual when one store window is broken each 
week. What is normal becomes abnormal at a time like this." 

When the window was broken, three extra police cars were 
sent to the area. Shortly after 11:00 p.m., the field super- 
visor dispatched three more cars and, observing the crowd 
gathering at the housing project, requested an additional 30 
patrolmen. The department activated its emergency recall plan. 

Since there are almost no recreational facilities, on any sum- 
mer night scores of youths may be found congregating on the 
streets near the housing projects. As more and more police cars 
patrolled the streets, rocks and bottles were thrown at them. 

Store windows were broken. Fires were set in trash cans 
and in the middle of the street. An expectation of impending 
violence gripped the crowd. 

Arriving on the scene, Human Rights Commission Execu- 
tive Director Hugh Barbour requested that, in order to relieve 
tension, the extra police be withdrawn from the immediate 
vicinity of the crowd. The officer in command agreed to pull 
back the patrols. 

Workers from the anti-poverty agency and the Human Re- 
lations Commission began circulating through the area, at- 
tempting to get kids off the street. Many of the residents had 
relatives and friends in Newark. Based on what had happened 
there, they feared that, if the disturbance were not curbed, it 
would turn into a bloodbath. 

The peacemakers were making little headway when a 
chicken fluttered out of the shattered window of a poultry 
market. One youth tried to throw gasoline on it and set it afire. 
As the gasoline sloshed onto the pavement, the chicken leaped. 
The flames merely singed its feathers. A gangling six-foot youth 
attempted to stomp the chicken. The bird, which had appeared 
dead, reacted violently. As it fluttered and darted out of his 
way, the youth screamed, slipped, and tumbled against a tree. 

The stark comedy reduced the tension. People laughed. Soon 
some began to drift home. 

A short time later a Molotov cocktail was thrown against 
the front of a tavern. Fire engines met with no opposition as 
they extinguished the flames before they could do much dam- 
age. 

The chief of police ordered the area cleared. As the officers 
moved in, the persons who remained on the street scattered. 
Within 15 minutes the neighborhood was deserted. 

72 


Both municipal authorities and Negro leaders feared that, 
if the disorder followed the pattern of other disturbances, there 
would be an intensification of action by youths the next day. 
Therefore, the next evening, police patrolled the 36 square 
blocks with more than 100 men, some of them stationed on 
rooftops. Tension mounted as residents viewed the helmeted 
officers, armed with shotguns and rifles. 

Early in the evening the mayor agreed to meet with a dele- 
gation of 13 community leaders. When they entered his office, 
the chief of police was already present. The mayor read him 
an order that, if he were faced with sniping or flagrant looting, 
his men were to: "Shoot to kill. . . . Force will be met with 
superior force." An officer's deviation from this order, the 
mayor said, would be considered dereliction of duty. 

Some of the members of the delegation believed that the 
mayor had staged the reading of this order for their benefit, 
and were not pleased by his action. They proposed a "peace- 
keeper task force." The mayor agreed to let them try. One 
hundred stickers with the word "Peacekeeper" were printed. 

One of those who agreed to be a peacemaker was Hesham 
Jaaber. Jaaber, who officiated at Malcolm X's funeral and has 
made two pilgrimages to Mecca, is a leader of a small sect of 
Orthodox Moslems. A teacher of Arabic and the Koran at the 
Spirit House in Newark, he is a militant who impressed the 
mayor with his sense of responsibility. 

Although Jaaber believed that certain people were sucking 
the life blood out of the community — "Count the number of 
taverns and bars in the Elizabeth port area and compare them 
with the number of recreation facilities" — he had witnessed 
the carnage in Newark and believed it could serve no purpose 
to have a riot. Two dozen of his followers, in red fezzes, took 
to the streets to urge order. He himself traveled about in a car 
with a bullhorn. 

As the peacekeepers began to make their influence felt, the 
police withdrew from the area. There was no further trouble. 

Nevertheless, many white citizens reacted unfavorably to 
the fact that police had permitted Negro community leaders 
to aid in the dispersal of the crowd on the first night. The police 
were called "yellow," and accused of allowing the looting and 
damaging of stores. 

In Englewood, a bedroom community of 28,000, astride 
the Palisades opposite New York, police had been expecting 
a riot by some of the city's 7,000 Negro residents since two 
weeks before Newark. As part of this expectation they had 
tested tear gas guns on the police firing range, situated in the 
middle of the Negro residential area. The wind had blown the 

73 


tear gas into surrounding houses. The occupants had been 
enraged. 

A continuing flow of rumors and anonymous tips to police 
of a riot in preparation had specified July 19 and July 28. 
However, the week following the Newark outbreak, the rumors 
began mentioning Friday, July 21, as the date. And it was on 
that day the chief of police became sufficiently concerned to 
alert the mayor, order mobilization of the police department, 
and request police assistance from Bergen County and nearby 
communities. The 160 officers who responded brought the 
total force in Englewood that evening to 220 men. 

At approximately 9:00 p.m. a rock was thrown through a 
market in the lower class Negro area, resulting in the setting 
off of a burglar alarm at police headquarters. Two police cars 
responded. They were hit by rocks. 

The tactical force of officers that had been assembled was 
rushed to the scene. A small number of persons, estimated in 
the official police report to be no more than 15 or 20, were 
standing in the street. When police formed a skirmish line, the 
loiterers, mostly youths, retreated into a large nearby park. 

As the police remained in the vicinity, people, attracted by 
the presence of the officers, began drifting out of the park. 
Angry verbal exchanges took place between the residents and 
the police. The Negroes demanded to see the mayor. 

The mayor arrived. The residents complained about the 
presence of so many police officers. Other grievances, many of 
them minor, began to be aired. According to the mayor, he 
became involved in a "shouting match," and departed. Shortly 
thereafter the police, too, left. 

They returned after receiving a report that two markets had 
been hit by Molotov cocktails. Arriving, they discovered fire- 
men fighting two small fires on the outside of the markets. 

The police ordered the people on the street to disperse and 
return to their homes. A rock knocked out a streetlight. Dark- 
ness blanketed the area. From behind hedges and other places 
of concealment a variety of missiles were thrown at the police. 
The officer in charge was cut severely when a bottle broke the 
windshield of a car. 

A fire department lighting unit was brought to the scene to 
illuminate the area. Except for some desultory rock throwing 
the neighborhood was quiet for the rest of the night. The only 
other disturbance occurred when a small band of youths made 
a foray into the city's principal business district two blocks 
away. Although a few windows were broken, there was no 
looting. Police quickly sealed off the area. 

The same pattern of disorders continued for the next three 
nights. A relatively large number of police, responding to the 

74 


breaking of windows or the setting of a fire, would come upon 
a small number of persons in the street. Fires repeatedly were 
set at or near the same two stores and a tavern. On one occa- 
sion two Negro youths threw Molotov cocktails at police offi- 
cers, and the officers responded with gunfire. 

Although sounds resembling gunshots were heard sporadi- 
cally throughout the area, no bullets or expended shells were 
found. Lt. William Clark who, as the Bergen County Police 
Department's civil disorders expert, was on the scene, reported 
that teenagers, as a harassing tactic, had exploded cherry bombs 
and firecrackers over a widely scattered area. Another view 
is that there may have been shots, but that they were fired into 
the air. 

Nevertheless, the press reported that: "Snipers set up a 
three-way crossfire at William and Jay Streets in the heart of 
the Fourth Ward Negro ghetto, and pinned down 100 police- 
men, four reporters and a photographer for more than an 
hour." 

These reports were "very definitely exaggerated and over- 
played," according to Deputy Chief William F. Harrington of 
the Englewood Police Department. What police termed a "dis- 
turbance" appeared in press reports as a "riot," and "was way 
out of proportion in terms of the severity of the situation." 

" I feel strongly," the Chief said, "that the news media . . • 
actually inflamed the situation day by day." 

VI. Plainfield 

New Jersey's worst violence outside of Newark was expe- 
rienced by Plainfield, a pleasant, tree-shaded city of 45,000. 
A "bedroom community," more than a third of whose resi- 
dents work outside the city, Plainfield had had relatively few 
Negroes until 1950/ By 1967 the Negro population had risen 
to an estimated 30 percent of the total. As in Englewood, 
there was a division between the Negro middle class, which 
lived in the East side "gilded ghetto," and the unskilled, un- 
employed and underemployed poor on the West side. 

Geared to the needs of a suburban middle class, the part- 
time and fragmented city government had failed to realize the 
change in character which the city had undergone, and was 
unprepared to cope with the problems of a growing disadvan- 
taged population. There was no full-time administrator or city 
manager. Boards, with independent jurisdiction over such areas 
as education, welfare and health, were appointed by the part- 
time mayor, whose own position was largely honorary. 

Accustomed to viewing politics as a gentleman's pastime, 
city officials were startled and upset by the intensity with which 

75 


demands issued from the ghetto. Usually such demands were 
met obliquely, rather than head-on. 

In the summer of 1966, trouble was narrowly averted over 
the issue of a swimming pool for Negro youngsters. In the 
summer of 1967, instead of having built the pool, the city 
began busing the children to the county pool a half -hour's 
ride distant. The fare was 25 cents/ per person, and the chil- 
dren had to provide their own lunch, a considerable strain 
on a frequent basis for a poor family with several children. 

The bus operated only on three days in mid-week. On week- 
ends the county pool was too crowded to accommodate chil- 
dren from the Plainfield ghetto. 

Pressure increased upon the school system to adapt itself 
to the changing social and ethnic backgrounds of its pupils. 
There were strikes and boycotts. The track system created 
de facto segregation within a supposedly integrated school 
system. Most of the youngsters from white middle-class dis- 
tricts were in the higher track, most from the Negro poverty 
areas in the lower. Relations were strained between some white 
teachers and Negro pupils. Two-thirds of school dropouts were 
estimated to be Negro. 

In February 1967 the NAACP, out of a growing sense of 
frustration with the municipal government, tacked a list of 
19 demands and complaints to the door of the city hall. Most 
dealt with discrimination in housing, employment and in the 
public schools. By summer, the city's common council had not 
responded. Although two of the 11 council members were 
Negro, both represented the East side ghetto. The poverty 
area was represented by two white women, one of whom had 
been appointed by the council after the elected representative, 
a Negro, had moved away. 

Relations between the police and the Negro community, 
tenuous at best, had been further troubled the week prior to 
the Newark outbreak. After being handcuffed during a routine 
arrest in a housing project, a woman had fallen down a flight 
of stairs. The officer said she had slipped. Negro residents 
claimed he had pushed her. 

When a delegation went to city hall to file a complaint, they 
were told by the city clerk that he was not empowered to 
accept it. Believing that they were being given the run-around, 
the delegation, angry and frustrated, departed. 

On Friday evening, July 14, the same police officer was 
moonlighting as a private guard at a diner frequented by Negro 
youths. He was, reportedly, number two on the Negro com- 
munity's "ten most-wanted" list of unpopular police officers. 

(The list was colorblind. Although out of 82 officers on the 
force only five were Negro, two of the 10 on the "most-wanted" 

76 


list were Negro. The two officers most respected in the Negro 
community were white. ) 

Although most of the youths at the diner were of high 
school age, one, in his mid-twenties, had a reputation as a 
bully. Sometime before 10 p.m., as a result of an argument, 
he hit a 16-year-old boy and split open his face. As the boy 
lay bleeding on the asphalt, his friends rushed to the police 
officer and demanded that he call an ambulance and arrest the 
offender. Instead, the officer walked over to the boy, looked 
at him, and reportedly said: "Why don't you just go home 
and wash up?" He refused to make an arrest. 

The youngsters were incensed. They believed that, had the 
two participants in the incident been white, the older youth 
would have been arrested, the younger taken to the hospital 
immediately. 

On the way to the housing project where most of them 
lived, the youths traversed four blocks of the city's business 
district. As they walked, they smashed three or four windows. 
An observer interpreted their behavior as a reaction to the in- 
cident at the diner, in effect challenging the police officer: 
"If you won't do anything about that, then let's see you do 
something about this!" 

On one of the quiet city streets two young Negroes, D. H. 
and L. C, had been neighbors. D. H. had graduated from 
high school, attended Fairleigh Dickinson University and, after 
receiving a degree in psychology, had obtained a job as a re- 
porter on the Plainfield Courier-News. 

L. C. had dropped out of high school, become a worker 
in a chemical plant, and, although still in his twenties, had 
married and fathered seven children. A man with a strong 
sense of family, he liked sports and played in the local base- 
ball league. Active in civil rights, he had, like the civil rights 
organizations, over the years, become more militant. For a 
period of time he had been a Muslim. 

The outbreak of vandalism aroused concern among the 
police. Shortly after midnight, in an attempt to decrease ten- 
sions, D. H. and the two Negro councilmen met with the 
youths in the housing project. The focal point of the youths' 
bitterness was the attitude of the police — until 1966 police 
had used the word "nigger" over the police radio and one 
officer had worn a Confederate belt buckle and had flown a 
Confederate pennant on his car. Their complaints, however, 
ranged over local and national issues. There was an overriding 
cynicism and disbelief that government would, of its own ac- 
cord, make meaningful changes to improve the lot of the 
lower class Negro. There was an overriding belief that there 
were two sets of policies by the people in power, whether law 

77 


enforcement officers, newspaper editors, or government offi- 
cials: one for white, and one for black. 

There was little confidence that the two councilmen could 
exercise any influence. One youth said: "You came down here 
last year. We were throwing stones at some passing cars and 
you said to us that this was not the way to do it. You got us to 
talk with the man. We talked to him. We talked with him, and 
we talked all year long. We ain't got nothing yet!" 

However, on the promise that meetings would be arranged 
with the editor of the newspaper and with the mayor later 
that same day, the youths agreed to disperse. 

At the first of these meetings the youths were, apparently, 
satisfied by the explanation that the newspaper's coverage was 
not deliberately discriminatory. The meeting with the mayor, 
however, proceeded badly. Negroes present felt that the mayor 
was complacent and apathetic, and that they were simply 
being given the usual lip service, from which nothing would 
develop. 

The mayor, on the other hand, told Commission investi- 
gators that he recognized that, "Citizens are frustrated by the 
political organization of the city," because he, himself, has 
no real power and "each of the councilmen says that he is 
just one of the 1 1 and therefore can't do anything." 

After approximately two hours, a dozen of the youths 
walked out, indicating an impasse and signalling the breakup 
of the meeting. Shortly thereafter window smashing began. A 
Molotov cocktail was set afire in a tree. One fire engine, in 
which a white and Negro fireman were sitting side by side, 
had a Molotov cocktail thrown at it. The white fireman was 
burned. 

As window smashing continued, liquor stores and taverns 
were especially hard hit. Some of the youths believed that 
there was an excess concentration of bars in the Negro sec- 
tion, and that these were an unhealthy influence in the com- 
munity. 

Because the police department had mobilized its full force, 
the situation, although serious, never appeared to get out of 
hand. Officers made many arrests. The chief of the fire depart- 
ment told Commission investigators that it was his conclusion 
that "individuals making fire bombs did not know what they 
were doing, or they could have burned the city." 

At 3 o'clock Sunday morning a heavy rain began, scatter- 
ing whatever groups remained on the streets. 

In the morning police made no effort to cordon off the 
area. As white sightseers and churchgoers drove by the housing 
project there was sporadic rock throwing. During the early 
afternoon such incidents increased. 

78 


At the housing project, a meeting was convened by L.C. to 
draw up a formal petition of grievances. As the youths gath- 
ered it became apparent that some of them had been drinking. 
A few kept drifting away from the parking lot where the 
meeting was being held to throw rocks at passing cars. It 
was decided to move the meeting to a county park several 
blocks away. 

Between 150 and 200 persons, including almost all of the 
rock throwers, piled into a caravan of cars and headed for 
the park. At approximately 3:30 p.m. the Chief of the Union 
County Park Police arrived to find the group being addressed 
by David Sullivan, Executive Director of the Human Relations 
Commission. He "informed Mr. Sullivan he was in violation 
of our park ordinance and to disperse the group." 

Sullivan and L.C. attempted to explain that they were in 
the process of drawing up a list of grievances, but the chief 
remained adamant. They could not meet in the park without 
a permit, and they did not have a permit. 

After permitting the group 10 to 15 minutes grace, the 
chief decided to disperse them. "Their mood was very excit- 
able," he reported, and "in my estimation no one could appease 
them so we moved them out without too much trouble. They 
left in a caravan of about 40 cars, horns blowing and yelling 
and headed south on West End Avenue to Plainfield." 

Within the hour looting became widespread. Cars were 
overturned, a white man was snatched off a motorcycle, and 
the fire department stopped responding to alarms because the 
police were unable to provide protection. After having been 
on alert until midday, the Plainfield Police Department was 
caught unprepared. At 6 p.m. only 18 men were on the streets. 
Checkpoints were established at crucial intersections in an 
effort to isolate the area. 

Officer John Gleason, together with two reserve officers, 
had been posted at one of the intersections, three blocks from 
the housing project. Gleason was a veteran officer, the son of 
a former lieutenant on the police department. Shortly after 
8 p.m. two white youths, chased by a 22-year-old Negro, Bobby 
Williams, came running from the direction of the ghetto toward 
Gleason's post. 

As he came in sight of the police officers, Williams stopped. 
Accounts vary of what happened next, or why Officer Gleason 
took the action he did. What is known is that when D. H., 
the newspaper reporter caught sight of him a minute or 
two later, Officer Gleason was two blocks from his post. Strid- 
ing after Williams directly into the ghetto area, Gleason al- 
ready had passed one housing project. Small groups were 
milling about. In D.H.'s words: "There was a kind of shock 

79 


and amazement," to see the officer walking by himself so 
deep in the ghetto. 

Suddenly there was a confrontation between Williams and 
Gleason. Some witnesses report Williams had a hammer in 
his hand. Others say he did not. When D.H., whose attention 
momentarily had been distracted, next saw Gleason he had 
drawn his gun and was firing at Williams. As Williams, criti- 
cally injured, fell to the ground Gleason turned and ran back 
toward his post. 

Negro youths chased him. Gleason stumbled, regained his 
balance, then had his feet knocked out from under him. A 
score of youths began to beat him and kick him. Some resi- 
dents of the apartment house attempted to intervene, but 
they were brushed aside. D. H. believes that, under the cir- 
cumstances and in the atmosphere that prevailed at that mo- 
ment, any police officer, black or white, would have been 
killed. 

After they had beaten Gleason to death, the youths took 
D.H.'s camera from him and smashed it. 

Fear swept over the ghetto. Many residents — both lawless 
and law-abiding — were convinced, on the basis of what had 
occurred in Newark, that law enforcement officers, bent on 
vengeance, would come into the ghetto shooting. 

People began actively to prepare to defend themselves. 
There was no lack of weapons. Forty-six carbines were stolen 
from a nearby arms manufacturing plant and passed out in 
the street by a young Negro, a former newspaper boy. Most 
of the weapons fell into the hands of youths, who began firing 
them wildly. A fire station was peppered with shots. 

Law enforcement officers continued their cordon about the 
area, but made no attempt to enter it except, occasionally, to 
rescue someone. National Guardsmen arrived shortly after 
midnight. Their armored personnel carriers were used to 
carry troops to the fire station, which had been besieged for 
five hours. During this period only one fire had been reported 
in the city. 

Reports of sniper firing, wild shooting, and general chaos 
continued until the early morning hours. 

By daylight Monday, New Jersey state officials had begun 
to arrive. At a meeting in the early afternoon, it was agreed 
that to inject police into the ghetto would be to risk bloodshed; 
that, instead, law enforcement personnel should continue to 
retain their cordon. 

All during the day various meetings took place between 
government officials and Negro representatives. Police were 
anxious to recover the carbines that had been stolen from the 
arms plant. Negroes wanted assurances against retaliation. In 

80 


the afternoon, L.C., an official of the Human Relations Com- 
mission, and others drove through the area urging people 
to be calm and to refrain from violence. 

At 8 p.m., the New Jersey attorney general, commissioner 
of community affairs, and commander of the state police, ac- 
companied by the mayor, went to the housing project and 
spoke to several hundred Negroes. Some members of the 
crowd were hostile. Others were anxious to establish a dialogue. 
There were demands that officials give concrete evidence that 
they were prepared to deal with Negro grievances. Again, the 
meeting was inconclusive. The officials returned to City Hall. 

At 9:15 p.m., L.C. rushed in claiming that — as a result 
of the failure to resolve any of the outstanding problems, and 
reports that people who had been arrested by the police were 
being beaten — violence was about to explode anew. The key 
demand of the militant faction was that those who had been 
arrested during the riot should be released. State officials de- 
cided to arrange for the release on bail of 1 2 arrestees charged 
with minor violations. L.C, in turn, agreed to try to induce 
return of the stolen carbines by Wednesday noon. 

As state officials were scanning the list of arrestees to de- 
termine which of them should be released, a message was 
brought to Colonel Kelly of the state police that general firing 
had broken out around the perimeter. 

The report testified to the tension: an investigation disclosed 
that one shot of unexplained origin had been heard. In re- 
sponse, security forces had shot out street lights, thus initiating 
the "general firing." 

At 4:00 o'clock Tuesday morning, a dozen prisoners were 
released from jail. Plainfield police officers considered this a 
"sellout." 

When, by noon on Wednesday, the stolen carbines had not 
been returned, the governor decided to authorize a mass search. 
At 2:00 p.m., a convoy of state police and National Guard 
troops prepared to enter the area. In order to direct the search 
as to likely locations, a handful of Plainfield police officers 
were spotted throughout the 28 vehicles of the convoy. 

As the convoy prepared to depart, the state community 
affairs commissioner, believing himself to be carrying out the 
decision of the governor not to permit Plainfield officers to 
participate in the search, ordered their removal from the vehi- 
cles. The basis for his order was that their participation might 
ignite a clash between them and the Negro citizens. 

As the search for carbines in the community progressed, 
tension increased rapidly. According to witnesses and news- 
paper reports, some men in the search force left apartments in 
shambles. 

81 


The search was called off an hour and a half after it was 
begun. No stolen weapons were discovered. For the Plainfield 
police, the removal of the officers from the convoy had been 
a humiliating experience. A half hour after the conclusion of 
the search, in a meeting charged with emotion, the entire de- 
partment threatened to resign unless the state community af- 
fairs commissioner left the city. He acceded to the demand. 

On Friday, seven days after the first outbreak, the city began 
returning to normal. 

VII. New Brunswick 

Although New Brunswick has about the same population as 
Plainfield, New Brunswick is a county seat and center of com- 
merce, with an influx of people during the day. No clearly 
defined Negro ghetto exists. Substantial proportions of the 
population are Puerto Rican, foreign-born, and Negro. 

All during the weekend, while violence sputtered, flared, 
subsided, then flared again in Plainfield, less than 10 miles 
away, there were rumors that "New Brunswick was really 
going to blow." Dissatisfaction in the Negro community re- 
volved around several issues: the closing of a local teenage 
coffee house by the police department, the lack of a swim- 
ming pool and other recreation facilities, and the release of a 
white couple on very low bond after they had been arrested 
for allegedly shooting at three Negro teenagers. As elsewhere, 
there was a feeling that the law was not being applied equally 
to whites and Negroes. 

By Monday, according to Mayor Patricia Sheehan, the town 
was "haunted by what had happened in Newark and Plain- 
field." James E. Amos, the associate director of the anti-poverty 
program in Middlesex County, said there was a "tenseness in 
the air" that "got thicker and thicker." 

Staff members of the anti-poverty agency met with the mayor 
and city commissioners to discuss what steps might be taken 
to reduce the tension. The mayor, who had been elected on a 
reform platform two months previously, appointed a Negro 
police officer, Lieutenant John Brokaw, as community liaison 
officer. He was authorized to report directly to the mayor. 

Negro officers in the department went into the streets in 
plain clothes to fight rumors and act as counter-rioters. Uni- 
formed police officers were counseled to act with restraint to 
avoid the possibility of a police action setting off violence. The 
radio station decided on its own initiative to play down rumors 
and news of any disturbance. 

The anti-poverty agency set up a task force of workers to 
go into all of the communities; white, Puerto Rican, and Ne- 

82 


gro, to report information and to try to cool the situation. 

The chief of police met with the chiefs of surrounding com- 
munities to discuss cooperation in case a disorder broke out. 

The streets remained quiet until past 9 p.m. Then scattered 
reports of windows being broken began to be received by po- 
lice. At 10:30 p.m. Amos noticed 100 youngsters marching in 
a column of twos down the street. A tall Negro minister stepped 
from the office of the anti-poverty agency and placed himself 
in the street in order to head them off. 

"Brothers! Stop! Let me talk to you!" he called out. 

The marchers brushed past him. A small boy, about 13 years 
old, looked up at the minister: 

"Black power, baby!" he said. 

The New Brunswick police were reinforced by 100 officers 
from surrounding communities. Roadblocks were set up on 
all principal thoroughfares into the city. 

Wild rumors swept the city: reports of armed Negro and 
white gangs, shootings, fires, beatings, and deaths. 

In fact, what was occurring was more in the nature of ran- 
dom vandalism. According to Mayor Sheehan, it was "like 
Halloween — a gigantic night of mischief." 

Tuesday morning the mayor imposed a curfew, and recorded 
a tape, played periodically over the city's radio station, appeal- 
ing for order. Most of the persons who had been picked up 
the previous night were released on their own recognizance 
or on low bail. 

The anti-poverty agency, whose summer program had not 
been funded until a few days previously, began hiring young- 
sters as recreational aides. So many teenagers applied that it 
was decided to cut each stipend in half and hire twice as many 
as planned. 

When the youngsters indicated a desire to see the mayor, 
she and the city commissioners agreed to meet with them. 
Although initially hostile, the 35 teenagers who made up the 
group "poured out their souls to the mayor." The mayor and 
the city commissioners agreed to the drawing up of a statement 
by the Negro youths attacking discrimination, inferior educa- 
tional and employment opportunities, police harassment, and 
poor housing. 

Four of the young people began broadcasting over the radio 
station, urging their "soul brothers and sisters" to "cool it, be- 
cause you will only get hurt and the mayor has talked with us 
and is going to do something for us." Other youths circulated 
through the streets with the same message. 

Despite these measures, a confrontation between the police 
and a crowd that gathered near a public housing project oc- 
curred that evening. The crowd was angry at the massive show 

83 


of force by police in riot dress. "If you don't get the cops out 
of here," one man warned, "we are all going to get our guns." 
Asked to return to their homes, people replied: "We will go 
home when you get the police out of the area." 

Requested by several city commissioners to pull back the 
uniformed police, the Chief at first refused. He was then told 
it was a direct order from the mayor. The police were with- 
drawn. 

A short time later, elements of the crowd — an older and 
rougher one than the night before — appeared in front of the 
police station. The participants wanted to see the mayor. 

Mayor Sheehan went out onto the steps of the station. Using 
a bullhorn, she talked to the people and asked that she be given 
an opportunity to correct conditions. The crowd was boister- 
ous. Some persons challenged the mayor. But, finally, the 
opinion, "She's new! Give her a chance!" prevailed. 

A demand was issued by people in the crowd that all persons 
arrested the previous night be released. Told that this already 
had been done, the people were suspicious. They asked to be 
allowed to inspect the jail cells. 

It was agreed to permit representatives of the people to look 
in the cells to satisfy themselves that everyone had been re- 
leased. 

The crowd dispersed. The New Brunswick riot had failed to 
materialize. 

VIII. Detroit 

On Saturday evening, July 22, the Detroit Police Depart- 
ment raided five "blind pigs." The blind pigs had had their 
origin in prohibition days, and survived as private social clubs. 
Often, they were after-hours drinking and gambling spots. 

The fifth blind pig on the raid list, the United Community 
and Civic League at the corner of 12th Street and Clairmount, 
had been raided twice before. Once 10 persons had been 
picked up; another time, 28. A Detroit Vice Squad officer had 
tried but failed to get in shortly after 10 o'clock Saturday night. 
He succeeded, on his second attempt, at 3:45 Sunday morning. 

The Tactical Mobile Unit, the Police Department's Crowd 
Control Squad, had been dismissed at 3:00 A.M. Since Sunday 
morning traditionally is the least troublesome time for police 
in Detroit— and all over the country— only 193 officers were 
patrolling the streets. Of these, 44 were in the 10th Precinct 
where the blind pig was located. 

Police expected to find two dozen patrons in the blind pig. 
That night, however, it was the scene of a party for several 
servicemen, two of whom were back from Vietnam. Instead 

84 


of two dozen patrons, police found 82. Some voiced resent- 
ment at the police intrusion. 

An hour went by before all 82 could be transported from 
the scene. The weather was humid and warm — the tempera- 
ture that day was to rise to 86 — and despite the late hour, 
many people were still on the street. In short order, a crowd 
of about 200 gathered. 

In November of 1965, George Edwards, Judge of the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and Com- 
missioner of the Detroit Police Department from 1961 to 1963, 
had written in the Michigan Law Review: 

It is clear that in 1965 no one will make excuses for any 
city's inability to foresee the possibility of racial trouble. ... Al- 
though local police forces generally regard themselves as public 
servants with the responsibility of maintaining law and order, 
they tend to minimize this attitude when they are patrolling areas 
that are heavily populated with Negro citizens. There, they tend 
to view each person on the streets as a potential criminal or 
enemy, and all too often that attitude is reciprocated. Indeed, 
hostility between the Negro communities in our large cities and 
the police departments, is the major problem in law enforcement 
in this decade. It has been a major cause of all recent race riots. 

At the time of Detroit's 1943 race riot, Judge Edwards told 
Commission investigators, there was "open warfare between 
the Detroit Negroes and the Detroit Police Department." As 
late as 1961, he had thought that "Detroit was the leading can- 
didate in the United States for a race riot." 

There was a long history of conflict between the police de- 
partment and citizens. During the labor battles of the 1930's, 
union members had come to view the Detroit Police Depart- 
ment as a strike-breaking force. The 1943 riot, in which 34 
persons died, was the bloodiest in the United States in a span 
of two decades. 

Judge Edwards and his successor, Commissioner Ray Girar- 
din, attempted to restructure the image of the department. A 
Citizens Complaint Bureau was set up to facilitate the filing 
of complaints by citizens against officers. In practice, however, 
this Bureau appeared to work little better than less enlightened 
and more cumbersome procedures in other cities. 

On 12th Street, with its high incidence of vice and crime, 
the issue of police brutality was a recurrent theme. A month 
earlier the killing of a prostitute had been determined by police 
investigators to be the work of a pimp. According to rumors 
in the community the crime had been committed by a Vice 
Squad officer. 

At about the same time, the killing of Danny Thomas, a 
27-year-old Negro Army veteran, by a gang of white youths 

85 


had inflamed the community. The city's major newspapers 
played down the story in hope that the murder would not be- 
come a cause for increased tensions. The intent backfired. A 
banner story in the Michigan Chronicle, the city's Negro news- 
paper, began: "As James Meredith marched again Sunday to 
prove a Negro could walk in Mississippi without fear, a young 
woman who saw her husband killed by a white gang, shouting: 
'Niggers keep out of Rouge Park,' lost her baby. 

"Relatives were upset that the full story of the murder was 
not being told, apparently in an effort to prevent the incident 
from sparking a riot." 

Some Negroes believed that the daily newspapers' treatment 
of the story was further evidence of the double standard: play- 
ing up crimes by Negroes, playing down crimes committed 
against Negroes. 

Although police arrested one suspect for murder, Negroes 
questioned why the entire gang was not held. What, they asked, 
would have been the result if a white man had been killed by 
a gang of Negroes? What if Negroes had made the kind of 
advances toward a white woman that the white men were 
rumored to have made toward Mrs. Thomas? 

The Thomas family lived only four or five blocks from the 
raided blind pig. A few minutes after 5:00 A.M., just after the 
last of those arrested had been hauled away, an empty bottle 
smashed into the rear window of a police car. A litter basket 
was thrown through the window of a store. Rumors circulated 
of excess force used by the police during the raid. A youth, 
whom police nicknamed "Mr. Greensleeves" because of the 
color of his shirt, was shouting: "We're going to have a riot!" 
and exhorting the crowd to vandalism. 

At 5:20 A.M. Commissioner Girardin was notified. He im- 
mediately called Mayor Jerome Cavanagh. Seventeen officers 
from other areas were ordered into the 10th Precinct. By 6:00 
A.M. police strength had grown to 369 men. Of these, how- 
ever, only 43 were committed to the immediate riot area. By 
that time the number of persons on 12th Street was growing 
into the thousands and widespread window-smashing and loot- 
ing had begun. 

On either side of 12th Street were neat, middle-class dis- 
tricts. Along 12th Street itself, however, crowded apartment 
houses created a density of more than 21,000 persons per 
square mile, almost double the city average. 

The movement of people when the slums of "Black Bottom" 
had been cleared for urban renewal had changed 12th Street 
from an integrated community into an almost totally black 
one, in which only a number of merchants remained white. 
Only 18 percent of the residents were homeowners. Twenty- 

86 


five percent of the housing was considered so substandard as to 
require clearance. Another 19 percent had major deficiencies. 

The crime rate was almost double that of the city as a whole. 
A Detroit police officer told Commission investigators that 
prostitution was so widespread that officers made arrests only 
when soliciting became blatant. The proportion of broken 
families was more than twice that in the rest of the city. 

By 7:50 A.M., when a 17-man police commando unit at- 
tempted to make the first sweep, an estimated 3,000 persons 
were on 12th Street. They offered no resistance. As the sweep 
moved down the street, they gave way to one side, and then 
flowed back behind it. 

A shoe store manager said he waited vainly for police for 
two hours as the store was being looted. At 8:25 A.M. some- 
one in the crowd yelled "The cops are coming!" The first 
flames of the riot billowed from the store. Firemen who re- 
sponded were not harassed. The flames were extinguished. 

By mid-morning, 1,122 men — approximately a fourth of the 
police department — had reported for duty. Of these, 540 were 
in or near the six-block riot area. One hundred and eight offi- 
cers were attempting to establish a cordon. There was, how- 
ever, no interference with looters, and police were refraining 
from the use of force. 

Commissioner Girardin said: "If we had started shooting 
in there . . . not one of our policemen would have come out 
alive. I am convinced it would have turned into a race riot in 
the conventional sense." 

According to witnesses, police at some roadblocks made 
little effort to stop people from going in and out of the area. 
Bantering took place between police officers and the populace, 
some still in pajamas. To some observers, there seemed at this 
point to be an atmosphere of apathy. On the one hand, the 
police failed to interfere with the looting. On the other, a num- 
ber of older, more stable residents, who had seen the street 
deteriorate from a prosperous commercial thoroughfare to one 
ridden by vice, remained aloof. 

Because officials feared that the 12th Street disturbance 
might be a diversion, many officers were sent to guard key 
installations in other sections of the city. Belle Isle, the recrea- 
tion area in the Detroit River that had been the scene of the 
1943 riot, was sealed off. 

In an effort to avoid attracting people to the scene, some 
broadcasters cooperated by not reporting the riot, and an 
effort was made to downplay the extent of the disorder. The 
facade of "business as usual" necessitated the detailing of 
numerous police officers to protect the 50,000 spectators that 

87 


were expected at that afternoon's New York Yankees-Detroit 
Tigers baseball game. 

Early in the morning a task force of community workers 
went into the area to dispel rumors and act as counter-rioters. 
Such a task force had been singularly successful at the time 
of the incident in the Kercheval district in the summer of 
1966, when scores of people had gathered at the site of an 
arrest. Kercheval, however, has a more stable population, 
fewer stores, less population density, and the city's most ef- 
fective police-community relations program. 

The 12th Street area, on the other hand, had been deter- 
mined, in a 1966 survey conducted by Dr. Ernest Harburg of 
the Psychology Department of the University of Michigan, 
to be a community of high stress and tension. An overwhelm- 
ing majority of the residents indicated dissatisfaction with 
their environment. 

Of those interviewed, 93 percent said they wanted to move 
out of the neighborhood; 73 percent felt that the streets were 
not safe; 91 percent believed that a person was likely to be 
robbed or beaten at night; 58 percent knew of a fight within 
the last 12 months in which a weapon had been employed; 
32 percent stated that they themselves owned a weapon; 57 
percent were worried about fires. 

A significant proportion believed municipal services to be 
inferior: 36 percent were dissatisfied with the schools; 43 per- 
cent with the city's contribution to the neighborhood; 77 
percent with the recreational facilities; 78 percent believed 
police did not respond promptly when they were summoned 
for help. 

United States Representative John Conyers, Jr., a Negro, 
was notified about the disturbance at his home, a few blocks 
from 12th Street, at 8:30 A.M. Together with other com- 
munity leaders, including Hubert G. Locke, a Negro and as- 
sistant to the commissioner of police, he began to drive around 
the area. In the side streets he asked people to stay in their 
homes. On 12th Street, he asked them to disperse. It was, 
by his own account, a futile task. 

Numerous eyewitnesses interviewed by Commission investi- 
gators tell of the carefree mood with which people ran in 
and out of stores, looting and laughing, and joking with the 
police officers. Stores with "Soul Brothers" signs appeared 
no more immune than others. Looters paid no attention to 
residents who shouted at them and called their actions sense- 
less. An epidemic of excitement had swept over the persons 
on the street. 

Congressman Conyers noticed a woman with a baby in 

88 


her arms; she was raging, cursing "whitey" for no apparent 
reason. 

Shortly before noon Congressman Conyers climbed atop a 
car in the middle of 12th Street to address the people. 
As he began to speak he was confronted by a m^n in his fifties 
whom he had once, as a lawyer, represented in court. The 
man had been active in civil rights. He believed himself to 
haw been persecuted as a result, and it was Conyers' opinion 
that he may have been wrongfully jailed. Extremely bitter, 
the man was inciting the crowd and challenging Conyers: "Why 
are you defending the cops and the establishment? You're 
just as bad as they are!" 

A police officer in the riot area told Commission investi- 
gators that neither he nor his fellow officers were instructed 
as to what they were supposed to be doing. Witnesses tell of 
officers standing behind saw-horses as an area was being looted 
— and still standing there much later, when the mob had 
moved elsewhere. A squad from the commando unit, wearing 
helmets with face-covering visors and carrying bayonet-tipped 
carbines, blockaded a street several blocks from the scene 
of the riot. Their appearance drew residents into the street. 
Some began to harangue them and to question why they were 
in an area where there was no trouble. Representative Con- 
yers convinced the police department to remove the com- 
mandos. 

By that time a rumor was threading through the crowd that 
a man had been bayoneted by the police. Influenced by such 
stories, the crowd became belligerent. At approximately 1:00 
P.M. stonings accelerated. Numerous officers reported injuries 
from rocks, bottles, and other objects thrown at them. Smoke 
billowed upward from four fires, the first since the one at 
the shoe store early in the morning. When firemen answered 
the alarms, they became the target for rocks and botdes. 

At 2:00 P.M. Mayor Cavanagh met with community and 
political leaders at police headquarters. Until then there had 
been hope that, as the people blew off steam, the riot would 
dissipate. Now the opinion was nearly unanimous that addi- 
tional forces would be needed. 

A request was made for state police aid. By 3:00 P.M. 360 
officers were assembling at the armory. At that moment loot- 
ing was spreading from the 12th Street area to other main 
thoroughfares. 

There was no lack of the disaffected to help spread it. Al- 
though not yet as hard-pressed as Newark, Detroit was, like 
Newark, losing population. Its prosperous middle-class whites 
were moving to the suburbs and being replaced by unskilled 
Negro migrants. Between 1960 and 1967 the Negro popula- 

89 


tion rose from just under 30 percent to an estimated 40 per- 
cent of the total. 

In a decade the school system had gained 50,000 to 60,000 
children. Fifty-one percent of the elementary school classes 
were overcrowded. Simply to achieve the statewide average, 
the system needed 1,650 more teachers and 1,000 additional 
classrooms. The combined cost would be $63 million. 

Of 300,000 school children, 171,000, or 57 percent, were 
Negro. According to the Detroit Superintendent of Schools, 
25 different school districts surrounding the city spent up to 
$500 more per pupil per year than Detroit. In the inner city 
schools, more than half the pupils who entered high school 
became dropouts. 

The strong union structure had created excellent conditions 
for most working men, but had left others, such as civil serv- 
ice and government workers, comparatively disadvantaged and 
dissatisfied. In June the "Blue Flu" had struck the city as 
police officers, forbidden to strike, had staged a sick-out. 
In September, the teachers were to go on strike. The starting 
wages for a plumber's helper were almost equal to the salary 
of a police officer or teacher. 

Some unions, traditionally closed to Negroes, zealously 
guarded training opportunities. In January of 1967 the school 
system notified six apprenticeship trades it would not open 
any new apprenticeship classes unless a large number of Ne- 
groes were included. By fall, some of the programs were still 
closed. 

High school diplomas from inner city schools were re- 
garded by personnel directors as less than valid. In July, 
unemployment was at a five-year peak. In the 12th Street area 
it was estimated to be between 12 and 15 percent for Negro 
men and 30 percent or higher for those under 25. 

The more education a Negro had, the greater the disparity 
between his income and that of a white with the same level 
of education. The income of whites and Negroes with a seventh 
grade education was about equal. The median income of 
whites with a high school diploma was $1,600 more per year 
than that of Negroes. White college graduates made $2,600 
more. In fact, so far as income was concerned, it made very 
little difference to a Negro man whether he had attended 
school for 8 years or for 12. In the fall of 1967, a study 
conducted at one inner city high school, Northwestern, showed 
that, although 50 percent of the dropouts had found work, 
90 percent of the 1967 graduating class was unemployed. 

Mayor Cavanagh had appointed many Negroes to key posi- 
tions in his administration, but in elective offices the Negro 
population was still under-represented. Of nine councilmen, 

90 


one was a Negro. Of seven school board members, two were 
Negroes. 

Although federal programs had brought nearly $360 mil- 
lion to the city between 1962 and 1967, the money appeared 
to have had little impact at the grassroots. Urban renewal, 
for which $38 million had been allocated, was opposed by 
many residents of the poverty area. 

Because of its financial straits, the city was unable to pro- 
duce on promises to correct such conditions as poor garbage 
collection and bad street lighting, which brought constant com- 
plaints from Negro residents. 

On 12th Street Carl Perry, the Negro proprietor of a drug 
store and photography studio, was dispensing ice cream, sodas, 
and candy to the youngsters streaming in and out of his store. 
For safekeeping he had brought the photography equipment 
from his studio, in the next block, to the drug store. The 
youths milling about repeatedly assured him that, although 
the market next door had been ransacked, his place of busi- 
ness was in no danger. 

In mid-afternoon the market was set afire. Soon after, the 
drug store went up in flames. 

State Representative James Del Rio, a Negro, was camping 
out in front of a building he owned when two small boys, 
neither more than 10 years old, approached. One prepared 
to throw a brick through a window. Del Rio stopped him: 
"That building belongs to me," he said. 

"I'm glad you told me, baby, because I was just about to 
bust you in!" the youngster replied. 

Some evidence that criminal elements were organizing spon- 
taneously to take advantage of the riot began to manifest 
itself. A number of cars were noted to be returning again 
and again, their occupants methodically looting stores. Months 
later, goods stolen during the riot were still being peddled. 

A spirit of carefree nihilism was taking hold. To riot and 
to destroy appeared more and more to become ends in them- 
selves. Late Sunday afternoon it appeared to one observer 
that the young people were "dancing amidst the flames." 

A Negro plainclothes officer was standing at an intersection 
when a man threw a Molotov cocktail into a business estab- 
lishment at the corner. In the heat of the afternoon, fanned 
by the 20 to 25 m.p.h. winds of both Sunday and Monday, 
the fire reached the home next door within minutes. As resi- 
dents uselessly sprayed the flames with garden hoses, the fire 
jumped from roof to roof of adjacent two and three-story 
buildings. Within the hour the entire block was in flames. 
The ninth house in the burning row belonged to the arsonist 
who had thrown the Molotov cocktail. 

91 


In some areas residents organized rifle squads to protect 
firefighters. Elsewhere, especially as the wind-whipped flames 
began to overwhelm the Detroit Fire Department and more 
and more residences burned, the firemen were subjected to]j 
curses and rock-throwing. 

Because of a lack of funds, on a per capita basis the de- 
partment is one of the smallest in the nation. In comparison I 
to Newark, where approximately 1,000 firemen patrol an area j 
of 16 square miles with a population of 400,000, Detroit's 
1,700 firemen must cover a city of 140 square miles with a j 
population of 1.6 million. Because the department had no 
mutual aid agreement with surrounding communities, it could 
not quickly call in reinforcements from outlying areas, and 
it was almost 9:00 P.M. before the first arrived. At one point, 
out of a total of 92 pieces of Detroit fire fighting equipment 
and 56 brought in from surrounding communities, only four 
engine companies were available to guard areas of the city 
outside of the riot perimeter. 

As the afternoon progressed the fire department's radio 
carried repeated messages of apprehension and orders of 
caution: 

There is no police protection here at all; there isn't a policeman 
in the area. ... If you have any trouble at all, pull out! . . . We're 
being stoned at the scene. It's going good. We need help! . . . 
Protect yourselves! Proceed away from the scene. . . . Engine 42 
over at Linwood and Gladstone. They are throwing bottles at us 
so we are getting out of the area. . . . All companies without 
police protection — all companies without police protection — 
orders are to withdraw, do not try to put out the fires. I repeat — 
all companies without police protection orders are to withdraw, 
do not try to put out the fires! 

It was 4:30 P.M. when the firemen, some of them exhausted 
by the heat, abandoned an area of approximately 100 square 
blocks on either side of 12th Street to await protection from 
police and National Guardsmen. 

During the course of the riot firemen were to withdraw 
283 times. 

Fire Chief Charles J. Quinlan estimated that at least two- 
thirds of the buildings were destroyed by spreading fires rather 
than fires set at the scene. Of the 683 structures involved, ap- 
proximately one-third were residential, and in few, if any, 
of these was the fire set originally. 

Governor George Romney flew over the area between 8:30 
and 9:00 P.M. "It looked like the city had been bombed on 
the west side and there was an area two-and-a-half miles by 
three-and-a-half miles with major fires, with entire blocks in 
flames," he told the Commission. 

92 


In the midst of chaos there were some unexpected indi- 
vidual responses. 

Twenty-four-year-old E. G., a Negro born in Savannah, 
Georgia, had come to Detroit in 1965 to attend Wayne State 
University. Rebellion had been building in him for a long 
time because, 

You just had to bow down to the white man. . . . When the 
insurance man would come by he would always call out to my 
mother by her first name and we were expected to smile and greet 
him happily. . . . Man, I know he would never have thought of 
me or my father going to his house and calling his wife by her 
first name. Then I once saw a white man slapping a young 
pregnant Negro woman on the street with such force that she 
just spun around and fell. I'll never forget that. 

When a friend called to tell him about the riot on 12th 
Street, E. G. went there expecting "a true revolt," but was 
disappointed as soon as he saw the looting begin: "I wanted 
to see the people really rise up in revolt. When I saw the 
first person coming out of the store with things in his arms, 
I really got sick to my stomach and wanted to go home. 
Rebellion against the white suppressors is one thing, but one 
measly pair of shoes or some food completely ruins the whole 
concept." 

E. G. was standing in a crowd, watching firemen work, 
when Fire Chief Alvin Wall called out for help from the 
spectators. E. G. responded. His reasoning was: "No matter 
what color someone is, whether they are green or pink or blue, 
I'd help them if they were in trouble. That's all there is to it." 

He worked with the firemen for four days, the only Negro 
in an all-white crew. Elsewhere, at scattered locations, a half 
dozen other Negro youths pitched in to help the firemen. 

At 4:20 P.M. Mayor Cavanagh requested that the National 
Guard be brought into Detroit. Although a major portion of 
the Guard was in its summer encampment 200 miles away, 
several hundred troops were conducting their regular week- 
end drill in the city. That circumstance obviated many prob- 
lems. The first troops were on the streets by 7:00 P.M. 

At 7:45 P.M. the mayor issued a proclamation instituting 
a 9:00 P.M. to 5:00 A.M. curfew. At 9:07 P.M. the first 
sniper fire was reported. Following his aerial survey of the 
city, Governor Romney, at or shortly before midnight, pro- 
claimed that "a state of public emergency exists" in the cities 
of Detroit, Highland Park, and Hamtramck. 

At 4:45 P.M. a 68-year-old white shoe repairman, George 
Messerlian, had seen looters carrying clothes from a cleaning 
establishment next to his shop. Armed with a saber, he had 

93 


rushed into the street, flailing away at the looters. One Negro 
youth was nicked on the shoulder. Another, who had not been 
on the scene, inquired as to what had happened. After he 
had been told, he allegedly replied: "I'll get the old man for 
you!" 

Going up to Messerlian, who had fallen or been knocked 
to the ground, the youth began to beat him with a club. Two 
other Negro youths dragged the attacker away from the old 
man. It was too late. Messerlian died four days later in the 
hospital. 

At 9:15 P.M. a 16-year-old Negro boy, superficially wound- 
ed while looting, became the first reported gunshot victim. 

At midnight Sharon George, a 23-year-old white woman, 
together with her two brothers, was a passenger in a car being 
driven by her husband. After having dropped off two Negro 
friends, they were returning home on one of Detroit's main 
avenues when they were slowed by a milling throng in the 
street. A shot fired from close range struck the car. The bullet 
splintered in Mrs. George's body. She died less than two hours 
later. 

An hour before midnight a 45-year-old white man, Walter 
Grzanka together with three white companions, went into the 
street. Shortly thereafter a market was broken into. Inside the 
show window a Negro man began filling bags with groceries 
and handing them to confederates outside the store. Grzanka 
twice went over to the store, accepted bags, and placed them 
down beside his companions across the street. On the third 
occasion he entered the market. When he emerged, the market 
owner, driving by in his car, shot and killed him. 

In Grzanka's pockets police found seven cigars, four pack- 
ages of pipe tobacco, and nine pairs of shoelaces. 

Before dawn four other looters were shot, one of them ac- 
cidentally while struggling with a police officer. A Negro youth 
and a National Guardsman were injured by gunshots of un- 
determined origin. A private guard shot himself while pulling 
his revolver from his pocket. In the basement of the 13th 
Precinct Police Station a cue ball, thrown by an unknown 
assailant, cracked against the head of a sergeant. 

At about midnight three white youths, armed with a shot- 
gun, had gone to the roof of their apartment building, located 
in an all-white block, in order, they said, to protect the build- 
ing from fire. At 2:45 A.M. a patrol car, carrying police offi- 
cers and National Guardsmen, received a report of "snipers 
on the roof." As the patrol car arrived, the manager of the 
building went to the roof to tell the youths they had better 
come down. 

The law enforcement personnel surrounded the building, 

94 


some going to the front, others to the rear. As the manager, 
together with the three youths, descended the fire escape in 
the rear, a National Guardsman, believing he heard shots from 
the front, fired. His shot killed 23-year-old Clifton Pryor. 

Early in the morning a young white fireman and a 49-year- 
old Negro homeowner were killed by fallen power lines. 

By 2:00 A. M. Monday, Detroit police had been augmented 
by 800 State Police officers and 1,200 National Guardsmen. 
An additional 8,000 Guardsmen were on the way. Neverthe- 
less, Governor Romney and Mayor Cavanagh decided to ask 
for federal assistance. At 2:15 A.M. the mayor called Vice 
President Hubert Humphrey, and was referred to Attorney 
General Ramsey Clark. A short time thereafter telephone con- 
tact was established between Governor Romney and the at- 
torney general.5 

There is some difference of opinion about what occurred 
next. According to the attorney general's office, the governor 
was advised of the seriousness of the request and told that the 
applicable federal statute required that, before federal troops 
could be brought into the city, he would have to state that the 
situation had deteriorated to the point that local and state 
forces could no longer maintain law and order. According to 
the governor, he was under the impression that he was being 
asked to declare that a "state of insurrection" existed in the 
city. 

The governor was unwilling to make such a declaration, 
contending that, if he did, insurance policies would not cover 
the loss incurred as a result of the riot. He and the mayor 
decided to re-evaluate the need for federal troops. 

Contact between Detroit and Washington was maintained 
throughout the early morning hours. At 9:00 A.M., as the 
disorder still showed no sign of abating, the governor and the 
mayor decided to make a renewed request for federal troops. 

Shortly before noon the President of the United States au- 
thorized the sending of a task force of paratroops to Self- 
ridge Air Force Base, near the city. A few minutes past 3:00 
P.M., Lt. General John L. Throckmorton, commander of Task 
Force Detroit, met Cyrus Vance, former Deputy Secretary of 
Defense, at the air base. Approximately an hour later the first 
federal troops arrived at the air base. 

After meeting with state and municipal officials, Mr. Vance, 
General Throckmorton, Governor Romney, and Mayor Cava- 
nagh, made a tour of the city, which lasted until 7:15 P.M. 

6 A little over two hours earlier, at 11:55 P.M. Mayor Cavanagh had in- 
formed the U.S. Attorney General that a "dangerous situation existed in the 
city." Details are set forth in the Final Report of Cyrus R. Vance, covering 
the Detroit Riots, released on September 12, 1967. 

95 


During this tour Mr. Vance and General Throckmorton inde- 
pendently came to the conclusion that — since they had seen no 
looting or sniping, since the fires appeared to be coming under 
control, and since a substantial number of National Guardsmen 
had not yet been committed— injection of federal troops wouldi 
be premature. 

As the riot alternately waxed and waned, one area of the* 
ghetto remained insulated. On the northeast side the residents 
of some 150 square blocks inhabited by 21,000 persons had, im 
1966, banded together in the Positive Neighborhood Actiom 
Committee (PNAC). With professional help from the Institutes 
of Urban Dynamics, they had organized block clubs and madee 
plans for the improvement of the neighborhood. In order to 
meet the need for recreational facilities, which the city was not 
providing, they had raised $3,000 to purchase empty lots for 
playgrounds. Although opposed to urban renewal, they had 
agreed to co-sponsor with the Archdiocese of Detroit a hous- 
ing project to be controlled jointly by the archdiocese and 
PNAC. 

When the riot broke out, the residents, through the block 
clubs, were able to organize quickly. Youngsters, agreeing to 
stay in the neighborhood, participated in detouring traffic. 
While many persons reportedly sympathized with the idea of 
a rebellion against the "system," only two small fires were set 
— one in an empty building. 

During the daylight hours Monday, nine more persons were 
killed by gunshots elsewhere in the city, and many others were 
seriously or critically injured. Twenty-three-year old Nathaniel 
Edmonds, a Negro, was sitting in his back yard when a young 
white man stopped his car, got out, and began an argument 
with him. A few minutes later, declaring that he was "going 
to paint his picture on him with a shotgun," the white man 
allegedly shotgunned Edmonds to death. 

Mrs. Nannie Pack and Mrs. Mattie Thomas were sitting on 
the porch of Mrs. Pack's house when police began chasing 
looters from a nearby market. During the chase officers fired 
three shots from their shotguns. The discharge from one of 
these accidentally struck the two women. Both were still in the 
hospital weeks later. 

Included among those critically injured when they were ac- 
cidentally trapped in the line of fire were an 8-year-old Negro 
girl and a 14-year-old white boy. 

As darkness settled Monday, the number of incidents re- 
reported to police began to rise again. Although many turned 
out to be false, several involved injuries to police officers, 
National Guardsmen, and civilians by gunshots of undeter- 
mined origin. 

96 


Watching the upward trend of reported incidents, Mr. Vance 
and General Throckmorton became convinced Federal troops 
should be used, and President Johnson was so advised. At 
11:20 P.M. the President signed a proclamation federalizing 
the Michigan National Guard and authorizing the use of the 
paratroopers. 

At this time there were nearly 5,000 Guardsmen in the city, 
but fatigue, lack of training, and the haste with which they 
had had to be deployed reduced their effectiveness. Some of 
the Guardsmen traveled 200 miles and then were on duty for 
30 hours straight. Some had never received riot training and 
were given on-the-spot instructions on mob control — only to 
discover that there were no mobs, and that the situation they 
faced on the darkened streets was one for which they were 
unprepared. 

Commanders committed men as they became available, often 
in small groups. In the resulting confusion, some units were 
lost in the city. Two Guardsmen assigned to an intersection 
on Monday were discovered still there on Friday. 

Lessons learned by the California National Guard two years 
earlier in Watts regarding the danger of overreaction and the 
necessity of great restraint in using weapons had not, appar- 
ently, been passed on to the Michigan National Guard. The 
young troopers could not be expected to know what a danger 
they were creating by the lack of fire discipline, not only to the 
civilian population but to themselves. 

A Detroit newspaper reporter who spent a night riding in a 
command jeep told a Commission investigator of machine guns 
being fired accidentally, street lights being shot out by rifle fire, 
and buildings being placed under siege on the sketchiest reports 
of sniping. Troopers would fire, and immediately from the dis- 
tance there would be answering fire, sometimes consisting of 
tracer bullets. 

In one instance, the newsman related, a report was received 
on the jeep radio that an Army bus was pinned down by sniper 
fire at an intersection. National Guardsmen and police, arriv- 
ing from various directions, jumped out and began asking each 
other: "Where's the sniper fire coming from?" As one Guards- 
man pointed to a building, everyone rushed about, taking cov- 
er. A soldier, alighting from a jeep, accidentally pulled the 
trigger on his rifle. As the shot reverberated through the dark- 
ness an officer yelled: "What's going on?" "I don't know," 
came the answer. "Sniper, I guess." 

Without any clear authorization or direction someone 
opened fire upon the suspected building. A tank rolled up and 
sprayed the building with .50 caliber tracer bullets. Law en- 
forcement officers rushed into the surrounded building and 

97 


discovered it empty. "They must be firing one shot and run- 
ning," was the verdict. 

The reporter interviewed the men who had gotten off the 
bus and were crouched around it. When he asked them about 
the sniping incident he was told that someone had heard a 
shot. He asked "Did the bullet hit the bus?" The answer was: 
"Well, we don't know." 

Bracketing the hour of midnight Monday, heavy firing, in- 
juring many persons and killing several, occurred in the south- 
eastern sector, which was to be taken over by the paratroopers 
at 4:00 A.M. Tuesday, and which was, at this time, considered 
to be the most active riot area in the city. 

Employed as a private guard, 55-year-old Julius L. Dorsey, 
a Negro, was standing in front of a market when accosted by 
two Negro men and a woman. They demanded he permit them 
to loot the market. He ignored their demands. They began 
to berate him. He asked a neighbor to call the police. As the 
argument grew more heated, Dorsey fired three shots from his 
pistol into the air. 

The police radio reported: "Looters, they have rifles." A 
patrol car driven by a police officer and carrying three National 
Guardsmen arrived. As the looters fled, the law enforcement 
personnel opened fire. When the firing ceased, one person lay 
dead. 

He was Julius L. Dorsey. 

In two areas — one consisting of a triangle formed by Mack, 
Gratiot, and E. Grand Boulevard, the other surrounding South- 
eastern High School — firing began shortly after 10:00 P.M. 
and continued for several hours. 

In the first of the areas, a 22-year-old Negro complained 
that he had been shot at by snipers. Later, a half dozen civilians 
and one National Guardsman were wounded by shots of un- 
determined origin. 

Henry Denson, a passenger in a car, was shot and killed 
when the vehicle's driver, either by accident or intent, failed 
to heed a warning to halt at a National Guard roadblock. 

Similar incidents occurred in the vicinity of Southeastern 
High School, one of the National Guard staging areas. As 
early as 10:20 P.M. the area was reported to be under sniper 
fire. Around midnight there were two incidents, the sequence 
of which remains in doubt. 

Shortly before midnight Ronald Powell, who lived three 
blocks east of the high school and whose wife was, momentar- 
ily, expecting a baby, asked the four friends with whom he 
had been spending the evening to take him home. He, to- 
gether with Edward Blackshear, Charles Glover, and John 
Leroy climbed into Charles Dunson's station wagon for the 

98 


short drive. Some of the five may have been drinking, but none 
was intoxicated. 

To the north of the high school they were halted at a Na- 
tional Guard roadblock, and told they would have to detour 
around the school and a fire station at Mack and St. Jean 
Streets because of the firing that had been occurring. Follow- 
ing orders, they took a circuitous route and approached Pow- 
ell's home from the south. 

On Lycaste Street, between Charlevoix and Goethe, they saw 
a jeep sitting at the curb. Believing it to be another roadblock, 
they slowed down. Simultaneously a shot rang out. A National 
Guardsman fell, hit in the ankle. 

Other National Guardsmen at the scene thought the shot had 
come from the station wagon. Shot after shot was directed 
against the vehicle, at least 17 of them finding their mark. All 
five occupants were injured, John Leroy fatally. 

At approximately the same time firemen, police, and Na- 
tional Guardsmen at the corner of Mack and St. Jean Streets, 
two and one-half blocks away, again came under fire from 
what they believed were rooftop snipers to the southeast, the 
direction of Charlevoix and Lycaste. The police and Guards- 
men responded with a hail of fire. 

When the shooting ceased, Carl Smith, a young firefighter, 
lay dead. An autopsy determined that the shot had been fired 
at street level, and, according to police, probably had come 
from the southeast. 

At 4:00 A.M. when paratroopers, under the command of 
Col. A. R. Boiling, arrived at the high school, the area was 
so dark and still that the colonel thought, at first, that he had 
come to the wrong place. Investigating, he discovered National 
Guard troops, claiming they were pinned down by sniper fire, 
crouched behind the walls of the darkened building. 

The colonel immediately ordered all the lights in the build- 
ing turned on and his troops to show themselves as con- 
spicuously as possible. In the apartment house across the street 
nearly every window had been shot out, and the walls were 
pockmarked with bullet holes. The colonel went into the 
building and began talking to the residents, many of whom 
had spent the night huddled on the floor. He reassured them 
no more shots would be fired. 

According to Lt. Gen. Throckmorton and Colonel Boiling, 
the city, at this time, was saturated with fear. The National 
Guardsmen were afraid, the residents were afraid, and the 
police were afraid. Numerous persons, the majority of them 
Negroes, were being injured by gunshots of undetermined 
origin. The general and his staff felt that the major task of the 
troops was to reduce the fear and restore an air of normalcy. 

99 


In order to accomplish this, every effort was made to estab- 
lish contact and rapport between the troops and the residents. 
Troopers — 20 percent of whom were Negro — began helping 
to clean up the streets, collect garbage, and trace persons who 
had disappeared in the confusion. Residents in the neighbor- 
hoods responded with soup and sandwiches for the troops. 
In areas where the National Guard tried to establish rapport 
with the citizens, there was a similar response. 

Within hours after the arrival of the paratroops the area 
occupied by them was the quietest in the city, bearing out 
General Throckmorton's view that the key to quelling a dis- 
order is to saturate an area with "calm, determined, and hard- 
ened professional soldiers." Loaded weapons, he believes, are 
unnecessary. Troopers had strict orders not to fire unless they 
could see the specific person at whom they were aiming. Mass 
fire was forbidden. 

During five days in the city, 2,700 Army troops expended 
only 201 rounds of ammunition, almost all during the first few 
hours, after which even stricter fire discipline was enforced. 
(In contrast, New Jersey National Guardsmen and State police 
expended 13,326 rounds of ammunition in three days in New- 
ark.) Hundreds of reports of sniper fire — most of them false 
— continued to pour into police headquarters; the Army logged 
only 10. No paratrooper was injured by a gunshot. Only one 
person was hit by a shot fired by a trooper. He was a young 
Negro who was killed when he ran into the line of fire as a 
trooper, aiding police in a raid on an apartment, aimed at a 
person believed to be a sniper. 

General Throckmorton ordered the weapons of all military 
personnel unloaded, but either the order failed to reach many 
National Guardsmen, or else it was disobeyed. 

Even as the general was requesting the city to relight the 
streets, Guardsmen continued shooting out the lights, and there 
are reports of dozens of shots being fired to dispatch one light. 
At one such location, as Guardsmen were shooting out the 
street lights, a radio newscaster reported himself to be pinned 
down by "sniper fire." 

On the same day that the general was attempting to restore 
normalcy by ordering street barricades taken down, Guardsmen 
on one street were not only, in broad daylight, ordering people 
off the street, but off their porches and away from the windows. 
Two persons who failed to respond to the order quickly enough 
were shot, one of them fatally. 

The general himself reported an incident of a Guardsman 
"firing across the bow" of an automobile that was approaching 
a roadblock. 

As in Los Angeles two years earlier, roadblocks that were 

100 


ill-lighted and ill-defined — often consisting of no more than a 
trash barrel or similar object with Guardsmen standing nearby 
— proved a continuous hazard to motorists. At one such road- 
block, National Guard Sergeant Larry Post, standing in the 
street, was caught in a sudden cross fire as his -fellow Guards- 
men opened up on a vehicle. He was the only soldier killed in 
the riot. 

With persons of every description arming themselves, and 
guns being fired accidentally or on the vaguest pretext all over 
the city, it became more and more impossible to tell who was 
shooting at whom. Some firemen began carrying guns. One 
accidentally shot and wounded a fellow fireman. Another in- 
jured himself. 

The chaos of a riot, and the difficulties faced by police offi- 
cers, are demonstrated by an incident that occurred at 2:00 
A.M. Tuesday. 

A unit of 12 officers received a call to guard firemen from 
snipers. When they arrived at the corner of Vicksburg and 
Lin wood in the 12th Street area, the intersection was well- 
lighted by the flames completely enveloping one building. 
Sniper fire was directed at the officers from an alley to the 
north, and gun flashes were observed in two buildings. 

As the officers advanced on the two buildings, Patrolman 
Johnie Hamilton fired several rounds from his machine- 
gun. Thereupon, the officers were suddenly subjected to fire 
from a new direction, the east. Hamilton, struck by four bullets, 
fell, critically injured, in the intersection. As two officers ran 
to his aid, they too were hit. 

By this time other units of the Detroit Police Department, 
state police, and National Guard had arrived on the scene, 
and the area was covered with a hail of gunfire. 

In the confusion the snipers who had initiated the shooting 
escaped. 

At 9:15 P.M. Tuesday, July 25, 38-year-old Jack Sydnor, 
a Negro, came home drunk. Taking out his pistol, he fired one 
shot into an alley. A few minutes later the police arrived. As 
his common-law wife took refuge in a closet, Sydnor waited, 
gun in hand, while the police forced open the door. Patrolman 
Roger Poike, the first to enter, was shot by Sydnor. Although 
critically injured, the officer managed to get off six shots in 
return. Police within the building and on the street then poured 
a hail of fire into the apartment. When the shooting ceased, 
Sydnor's body, riddled by the gunfire, was found lying on the 
ground outside a window. 

Nearby, a state police officer and a Negro youth were struck 
and seriously injured by stray bullets. As in other cases where 

101 


the origin of the shots was not immediately determinable, 
police reported them as "shot by sniper." 

Reports of "heavy sniper fire" poured into police headquar- 
ters from the two blocks surrounding the apartment house 
where the battle with Jack Sydnor had taken place. National 
Guard troops with two tanks were dispatched to help flush 
out the snipers. 

Shots continued to be heard throughout the neighborhood. 
At approximately midnight — there are discrepancies as to the 
precise time — a machine gunner on a tank, startled by several 
shots, asked the assistant gunner where the shots were coming 
from. The assistant gunner pointed toward a flash in the win- 
dow of an apartment house from which there had been earlier 
reports of sniping. 

The machine gunner opened fire. As the slugs ripped through 
the window and walls of the apartment, they nearly severed 
the arm of 21 -year-old Valerie Hood. Her 4-year-old niece, 
Tonya Blanding, toppled dead, a .50 caliber bullet hole in her 
chest. 

A few seconds earlier, 19-year-old Bill Hood, standing in 
the window, had lighted a cigarette. 

Down the street, a bystander was critically injured by a 
stray bullet. Simultaneously, the John C. Lodge Freeway, two 
blocks away, was reported to be under sniper fire. Tanks and 
National Guard troops were sent to investigate. At the Harlan 
House Motel, ten blocks from where Tonya Blanding had died 
a short time earlier, Mrs. Helen Hall, a 51 -year-old white busi- 
nesswoman, opened the drapes of the fourth floor hall window. 
Calling out to other guests, she exclaimed: "Look at the tanks!" 

She died seconds later as bullets began to slam into the 
building. As the firing ceased, a 19-year-old Marine, car- 
rying a Springfield rifle, burst into the building. When, acci- 
dentally, he pushed the rifle barrel through a window, the firing 
commenced anew. A police investigation showed that the Ma- 
rine, who had just decided to "help out" the law enforcement 
personnel, was not involved in the death of Mrs. Hall. 

R. R., a white 27 -year-old coin dealer, was the owner of an 
expensive, three-story house on "L" Street, an integrated mid- 
dle class neighborhood. In May of 1966, he and his wife and 
child had moved to New York and had rented the house to 
two young men. After several months he had begun to have 
problems with his tenants. On one occasion he reported to his 
attorney that he had been threatened by them. 

In March of 1967, R. R. instituted eviction proceedings, 
rhese were still pending when the riot broke out. Concerned 
about the house, R. R. decided to fly to Detroit. When he 

102 


arrived at the house, on Wednesday, July 26, he discovered 
the tenants were not at home. 

He then called his attorney, who advised him to take physi- 
cal possession of the house and, for legal purposes, to take 
witnesses along. 

Together with his 17-year-old brother and another white 
youth, R. R. went to the house, entered, and began changing 
the locks on the doors. For protection they brought a .22 cali- 
ber rifle, which R. R.'s brother took into the cellar and fired 
into a pillow in order to test it. 

Shortly after 8:00 P.M., R. R. called his attorney to advise 
him that the tenants had returned, and he had refused to admit 
them. Thereupon, R. R. alleged, the tenants had threatened 
to obtain the help of the National Guard. The attorney re- 
lates that he was not particularly concerned. He told R. R. 
that if the National Guard did appear he should have the 
officer in charge call him (the attorney). 

At approximately the same time the National Guard claims 
it received information to the effect that several men had 
evicted the legal occupants of the house, and intended to start 
sniping after dark. 

A National Guard column was dispatched to the scene. 
Shortly after 9:00 P.M., in the half-light of dusk, the column 
of approximately 30 men surrounded the house. A tank took 
position on a lawn across the street. The captain commanding 
the column placed in front of the house an explosive device 
similar to a firecracker. After setting this off in order to draw 
the attention of the occupants to the presence of the column, 
he called for them to come out of the house. No attempt was 
made to verify the truth or falsehood of the allegations regard- 
ing snipers. 

When the captain received no reply from the house, he 
began counting to 10. As he was counting, he said, he heard 
a shot, the origin of which he could not determine. A few 
seconds later he heard another shot and saw a "fire streak" 
coming from an upstairs window. He thereupon gave the order 
to fire. 

According to the three young men, they were on the second 
floor of the house and completely bewildered by the barrage 
of fire that was unleashed against it. As hundreds of bullets 
crashed through the first and second-story windows and rico- 
cheted off the walls, they dashed to the third floor. Protected 
by a large chimney, they huddled in a closet until, during a 
lull in the firing, they were able to wave an item of clothing 
out of the window as a sign of surrender. They were arrested 
as snipers. 

The firing from rifles and machine guns had been so intense 

103 


that in a period of a few minutes it inflicted an estimated 
$10,000 worth of damage. One of a pair of stone columns 
was shot nearly in half. 

Jailed at the 10th Precinct Station sometime Wednesday 
night R. R. and his two companions were taken from their 
cell to an "alley court," police slang for an unlawful attempt 
to make prisoners confess. A police officer, who has resigned 
from the force, allegedly administered such a severe beating 
to R. R. that the bruises still were visible two weeks later. 

R. R/s 17-year-old brother had his skull cracked open, and 
was thrown back into the cell. He was taken to a hospital only 
when other arrestees complained that he was bleeding to death. 

At the preliminary hearing 12 days later the prosecution 
presented only one witness, the National Guard captain who 
had given the order to fire. The police officer who had signed 
the original complaint was not asked to take the stand. The 
charges against all three of the young men were dismissed. 

Nevertheless, the morning after the original incident, a major 
metropolitan newspaper in another section of the country com- 
posed the following banner story from wire service reports: 

DETROIT, July 27 (Thursday)— Two National Guard tanks 
ripped a sniper's haven with machine guns Wednesday night and 
flushed out three shaggy-haired white youths. Snipers attacked a 
guard command post and Detroit's racial riot set a modern 
record for bloodshed. The death toll soared to 36, topping the 
Watts bloodbath of 1966 in which 35 died and making Detroit's 
insurrection the most deadly racial riot in modern U. S. history. 

In the attack on the sniper's nest, the Guardsmen poured hun- 
dreds of rounds of .50 caliber machine gun fire into the home, 
which authorities said housed arms and ammunition used by 
West Side sniper squads. 

Guardsmen recovered guns and ammunition. A reporter with 
the troopers said the house, a neat brick home in a neighborhood 
of $20,000 to $50,000 homes, was torn apart by the machine gun 
and rifle fire. 

Sniper fire crackled from the home as the Guard unit ap- 
proached. It was one of the first verified reports of sniping by 
whites. . . . 

A pile of loot taken from riot-ruined stores was recovered from 
the sniper's haven, located ten blocks from the heart of the 200- 
square block riot zone. 

Guardsmen said the house had been identified as a storehouse 
of arms and ammunition for snipers. Its arsenal was regarded as 
an indication that the sniping — or at least some of it — was 
organized. 

As hundreds of arrestees were brought into the 10th Pre- 
cinct Station, officers took it upon themselves to carry on inves- 

104 


ligations and to attempt to extract confessions. Dozens of 
charges of police brutality emanated from the station as pris- 
oners were brought in uninjured, but later had to be taken to 
the hospital. 

In the absence of the precinct commander, who had trans- 
ferred his headquarters to the riot command post at a nearby 
hospital, discipline vanished. Prisoners who requested that they 
be permitted to notify someone of their arrest were almost 
invariably told that: "The telephones are out of order." Con- 
gressman Conyers and State Representative Del Rio, who went 
to the station hoping to coordinate with the police the estab- 
lishing of a community patrol, were so upset by what they saw 
that they changed their minds and gave up on the project. 

A young woman, brought into the station, was told to strip. 
After she had done so, and while an officer took pictures with 
a Polaroid camera, another officer came up to her and began 
fondling her. The negative of one of the pictures, fished out 
of a waste basket, subsequently was turned over to the mayor's 
office. 

Citing the sniper danger, officers throughout the department 
had taken off their bright metal badges. They also had taped 
over the license plates and the numbers of the police cars. 
Identification of individual officers became virtually impossible. 
On a number of occasions officers fired at fleeing looters, 
then made little attempt to determine whether their shots had 
hit anyone. Later some of the persons were discovered dead 
or injured in the street. 

In one such case police and National Guardsmen were inter- 
rogating a youth suspected of arson when, according to offi- 
cers, he attempted to escape. As he vaulted over the hood of 
an automobile, an officer fired his shotgun. The youth dis- 
appeared on the other side of the car. Without making an 
investigation, the officers and Guardsmen returned to their 
car and drove off. 

When nearby residents called police, another squad car 
arrived to pick up the body. Despite the fact that an autopsy 
disclosed the youth had been killed by five shotgun pellets, 
only a cursory investigation was made, and the death was 
attributed to "sniper fire." No police officer at the scene during 
the shooting filed a report. 

Not until a Detroit newspaper editor presented to the police 
the statements of several witnesses claiming that the youth had 
been shot by police after he had been told to run did the 
department launch an investigation. Not until three weeks after 
the shooting did an officer come forward to identify himself as 
the one who had fired the fatal shot. 

105 


Citing conflicts in the testimony of the score of witnesses, 
the Detroit Prosecutor's office declined to press charges. 

Prosecution is proceeding in the case of three youths in 
whose shotgun deaths law enforcement personnel were impli- 
cated following a report that snipers were firing from the 
Algiers Motel. In fact, there is little evidence that anyone fired 
from inside the building. Two witnesses say that they had seen 
a man, standing outside of the motel, fire two shots from a 
rifle. The interrogation of other persons revealed that law en- 
forcement personnel then shot out one or more street lights. 
Police patrols responded to the shots. An attack was launched 
on the motel. 

The picture is further complicated by the fact that this in- 
cident occurred at roughly the same time that the National 
Guard was directing fire at the apartment house in which 
Tonya Blanding was killed. The apartment house was only six 
blocks distant from and in a direct line with the motel. 

The killings occurred when officers began on-the-spot ques- 
tioning of the occupants of the motel in an effort to discover 
weapons used in the "sniping." Several of those questioned 
reportedly were beaten. One was a Negro ex-paratrooper who 
had only recently been honorably discharged, and had gone 
to Detroit to look for a job. 

Although by late Tuesday looting and fire-bombing had 
virtually ceased, between 7:00 and 1 1 :00 P.M. that night there 
were 444 reports of incidents. Most were reports of sniper 
fire. 

During the daylight hours of July 26th, there were 534 such 
reports. Between 8:30 and 11:00 P.M. there were 255. As 
they proliferated, the pressure on law enforcement officers to 
uncover the snipers became intense. Homes were broken into. 
Searches were made on the flimsiest of tips. A Detroit news- 
paper headline aptly proclaimed: "Everyone's Suspect in No 
Man's Land." 

Before the arrest of a young woman IBM operator in the 
city assessor's office brought attention to the situation on Fri- 
day, July 28th, any person with a gun in his home was liable 
to be picked up as a suspect. 

Of the 27 persons charged with sniping, 22 had charges 
against them dismissed at preliminary hearings, and the charges 
against two others were dismissed later. One pleaded guilty to 
possession of an unregistered gun and was given a suspended 
sentence. Trials of two are pending. 

In all, more than 7,200 persons were arrested. Almost 3,000 
of these were picked up on the second day of the riot, and by 
midnight Monday 4,000 were incarcerated in makeshift jails. 

106 


Some were kept as long as 30 hours on buses. Others spent 
days in an underground garage without toilet facilities. An un- 
counted number were people who had merely been unfortunate 
enough to be on the wrong street at the wrong time. Included 
were members of the press whose attempts to show their 
credentials had been ignored. Released later, they were chided 
for not having exhibited their identification at the time of their 
arrests. 

The booking system proved incapable of adequately han- 
dling the large number of arrestees. People became lost for 
days in the maze of different detention facilities. Until the 
later stages, bail was set deliberately high, often at $10,000 or 
more. When it became apparent that this policy was unrealistic 
and unworkable, the Prosecutor's office began releasing on 
low bail or on their own recognizance hundreds of those who 
had been picked up. Nevertheless, this fact was not publicized 
for fear of antagonizing those who had demanded a high-bail 
policy. 

Of the 43 persons who were killed during the riot, 33 were 
Negro and 10 were white. Seventeen were looters, of whom 
two were white. Fifteen citizens (of whom four were white), 
one white National Guardsman, one white fireman, and one 
Negro private guard died as the result of gunshot wounds. 
Most of these deaths appear to have been accidental, but crim- 
inal homicide is suspected in some. 

Two persons, including one fireman, died as a result of 
fallen power lines. Two were burned to death. One was a 
drunken gunman; one an arson suspect. One white man was 
killed by a rioter. One police officer was felled by a shotgun 
blast when his gun, in the hands of another officer, accidentally 
discharged during a scuffle with a looter. 

Action by police officers accounted for 20 and, very likely, 
21 of the deaths; action by the National Guard for seven, and, 
very likely, nine; action by the Army for one. Two deaths 
were the result of action by store owners. Four persons died 
accidentally. Rioters were responsible for two, and perhaps 
three of the deaths; a private guard for one. A white man is 
suspected of murdering a Negro youth. The perpetrator of one 
of the killings in the Algiers Motel remains unknown. 

Damage estimates, originally set as high as $500 million, 
were quickly scaled down. The city assessor's office placed the 
loss — excluding business stock, private furnishings, and the 
buildings of churches and charitable institutions — at approxi- 
mately $22 million. Insurance payments, according to the State 
Insurance Bureau, will come to about $32 million, representing 
an estimated 65 to 75 percent of the total loss. 

107 


By Thursday, July 27, most riot activity had ended. The 
paratroopers were removed from the city on Saturday. On 
Tuesday, August 1, the curfew was lifted and the National 
Guard moved out. 

Methodology — Profiles of Disorder 

Construction of the Profiles of Disorder began with surveys 
by field teams in 23 cities. From an analysis of the documents 
compiled and field interviews, 10 of the 23, a fair cross section 
of the cities, were chosen for intensive further investigation. 

A special investigating group was dispatched to each city 
under study to conduct in-depth interviews of persons pre- 
viously questioned, and others that had come to our attention 
as a result of the analysis. Additional documents were obtained. 
In the process of acquisition, analysis, and distillation of in- 
formation, the special investigating group made several trips 
to each city. In the meantime, the regular field teams continued 
to conduct their surveys and report additional information. 

The approximately 1200 persons interviewed represent a 
cross section of officials, observers, and participants involved 
in the riot process: from mayors, police chiefs, and army offi- 
cers to Black Power advocates and rioters. Experts in diverse 
fields, such as taxation, fire fighting, and psychology, were 
consulted. Testimony presented to the Commission in closed 
hearings was incorporated. 

Many official documents were used in compiling chronolo- 
gies and corroborating statements made by witnesses. These 
included but were not limited to police department and other 
law enforcement agencies' after-action reports, logs, incident 
reports, injury reports, and reports of homicide investigations; 
after-action reports of U.S. Army and National Guard units; 
FBI reports; fire department logs and reports; and reports 
from Prosecutors' offices and other investigating agencies. 

About 1500 pages of depositions were taken from 90 wit- 
nesses to substantiate each of the principal items in the Profiles. 

Since some information was supplied to the Commission on 
a confidential basis, a fully annotated, footnoted copy of the 
Profiles cannot be made public at this time, but will be de- 
posited in the Archives of the United States.

Chapter 2 / Patterns o£ Disorder* 

INTRODUCTION 

The President asked the Commission to answer several spe- 
cific questions about the nature of riots: 

• The kinds of communities where they occurred; 

• The characteristics — including age, education, and job history — 
of those who rioted and those who did not; 

• The ways in which groups of lawful citizens can be encouraged 
to help cool the situation; 

• The relative impact of various depressed conditions in the ghetto 
which stimulated people to riot; 

• The impact of federal and other programs on those conditions; 

• The effect on rioting of police-community relationships; 

• The parts of the community which suffered the most as a result 
of the disorders. 

The profiles in the foregoing chapter portray the nature 
and extent of 10 of the disorders which took place during the 
summer of 1967. This chapter seeks in these events and in the 
others which we surveyed a set of common elements to aid 
in understanding what happened and in answering the Presi- 
dent's questions. 

This chapter also considers certain popular conceptions 
about riots. Disorders are often discussed as if there were a 
single type. The "typical" riot of recent years is sometimes 
seen as a massive uprising against white people, involving 
widespread burning, looting, and sniping, either by all ghetto 
Negroes or by an uneducated, Southern-born Negro underclass 
of habitual criminals or "riffraff." An agitator at a protest dem- 
onstration, the coverage of events by the news media, or an 
isolated "triggering" or "precipitating" incident is often iden- 
tified as the primary spark of violence. A uniform set of stages 
is sometimes posited, with a succession of confrontations and 
withdrawals by two cohesive groups, the police on one side 
and a riotous mob on the other. Often it is assumed that there 
was no effort within the Negro community to reduce the 
violence. Sometimes the only remedy prescribed is application 
of the largest possible police or control force, as early as 
possible. 

What we have found does not validate these conceptions. 
We have been unable to identify constant patterns in all as- 
pects of civil disorders. We have found that they are unusual, 

* Notes appear at end of chapter. 

109 


irregular, complex and, in the present state of knowledge, 
unpredictable social processes. Like many human events, they 
do not unfold in orderly sequences. 

Moreover, we have examined the 1967 disorders within 
a few months after their occurrence and under pressing time 
limitations. While we have collected information of consider- 
able immediacy, analysis will undoubtedly improve with the 
passage and perspective of time and with the further accu- 
mulation and refinement of data. To facilitate further analysis 
we have appended much of our data to this report. 

We have categorized the information now available about 
the 1967 disorders as follows. 

• The pattern of violence over the nation: severity, location, timing, 
and numbers of people involved; 

• The riot process in a sample of 24 disorders we have surveyed:* 
prior events, the development of violence, the various control ef- 
forts on the part of officials and the community, and the relation- 
ship between violence and control efforts; 

• The riot participants: a comparison of rioters with those who 
sought to limit the disorder and those who remained uninvolved; 

• The setting in which the disorders occurred: social and economic 
conditions, local governmental structure, the scale of federal pro- 
grams, and the grievance reservoir in the  Negro  community; 

• The aftermath of disorder: the ways in which communities re- 
sponded after order was restored in the streets. 

Based upon information derived from our surveys, we offer 
the following generalizations: 

1. No civil disorder was "typical" in all respects. Viewed 
in a national framework, the disorders of 1967 varied greatly 
in terms of violence and damage: while a relatively small 
number were major under our criteria and a somewhat larger 
number were serious, most of the disorders would have re- 
ceived little or no national attention as "riots" had the nation 
not been sensitized by the more serious outbreaks. 

2. While the civil disorders of 1967 were racial in char- 
acter, they were not interracial. The 1967 disorders, as well 
as earlier disorders of the recent period, involved action within 
Negro neighborhoods against symbols of white American so- 
ciety— authority and property — rather than against white 
persons. 

3. Despite extremist rhetoric, there was no attempt to sub- 
vert the social order of the United States. Instead, most of 
those who attacked white authority and property seemed to 
be demanding fuller participation in the social order and the

our survey procedures. 

110 


material benefits enjoyed by the vast majority of American 
citizens. 

4. Disorder did not typically erupt without preexisting 
causes, as a result of a single ''triggering" or "precipitating" 
incident. Instead, it developed out of an increasingly dis- 
turbed social atmosphere, in which typically a series of ten- 
sion-heightening incidents over a period of weeks or months 
became linked in the minds of many in the Negro community 
with a shared reservoir of underlying grievances. 

5. There was, typically, a complex relationship between 
the series of incidents and the underlying grievances. For ex- 
ample, grievances about allegedly abusive police practices, 
unemployment and underemployment, housing and other con- 
ditions in the ghetto, were often aggravated in the minds of 
many Negroes by incidents involving the police, or the inaction 
of municipal authorities on Negro complaints about police 
action, unemployment, inadequate housing or other conditions. 
When grievance-related incidents recurred and rising tensions 
were not satisfactorily resolved, a cumulative process took 
place in which prior incidents were readily recalled and griev- 
ances reinforced. At some point in the mounting tension, 
a further incident — in itself often routine or even trivial — 
became the breaking point, and tension spilled over into 
violence. 

6. Many grievances in the Negro community result from 
the discrimination, prejudice and powerlessness which Negroes 
often experience. They also result from the severely disad- 
vantaged social and economic conditions of many Negroes 
as compared with those of whites in the same city and, more 
particularly, in the predominantly white suburbs. 

7. Characteristically, the typical rioter was not a hoodlum, 
habitual criminal, or riffraff; nor was he a recent migrant, a 
member of an uneducated underclass, or a person lacking 
broad social and political concerns. Instead, he was a teen- 
ager or young adult, a lifelong resident of the city in which 
he rioted, a high-school drop-out — but somewhat better edu- 
cated than his Negro neighbor — and almost invariably under- 
employed or employed in a menial job. He was proud of his 
race, extremely hostile to both whites and middle-class Ne- 
groes and, though informed about politics, highly distrustful 
of the political system and of political leaders. 

8. Numerous Negro counter-rioters walked the streets urg- 
ing rioters to "cool it." The typical counter-rioter resembled 
in many respects the majority of Negroes, who neither rioted 
nor took action against the rioters, that is, the non-involved. 
But certain  differences  are  crucial:  the  counter-rioter  was 

111 


better educated and had higher income than either the rioter 
or the noninvolved. 

9. Negotiations between Negroes and white officials oc- 
curred during virtually all the disorders surveyed. The nego- 
tiations often involved young, militant Negroes as well as 
older, established leaders. Despite a setting of chaos and dis- 
order, negotiations in many cases involved discussion of un- 
derlying grievances as well as the handling of the disorder 
by control authorities. 

10. The chain we have identified — discrimination, preju- 
dice, disadvantaged conditions, intense and pervasive griev- 
ances, a series of tension-heightening incidents, all culminating 
in the eruption of disorder at the hands of youthful, politically- 
aware activists — must be understood as describing the central 
trend in the disorders, not as an explanation of all aspects 
of the riots or of all rioters. Some rioters, for example, may 
have shared neither the conditions nor the grievances of their 
Negro neighbors; some may have coolly and deliberately 
exploited the chaos created by others; some may have been 
drawn into the melee merely because they identified with, 
or wished to emulate, others. Nor do we intend to suggest 
that the majority of the rioters, who shared the adverse condi- 
tions and grievances, necessarily articulated in their own minds 
the connection between that background and their actions. 

11. The background of disorder in the riot cities was typi- 
cally characterized by severely disadvantaged conditions for 
Negroes, especially as compared with those for whites; a local 
government often unresponsive to these conditions; federal 
programs which had not yet reached a significantly large pro- 
portion of those in need; and the resulting reservoir of per- 
vasive and deep grievance and frustration in the ghetto. 

12. In the immediate aftermath of disorder, the status quo 
of daily life before the disorder generally was quickly re- 
stored. Yet, despite some notable public and private efforts, 
little basic change took place in the conditions underlying 
the disorder. In some cases, the result was increased distrust 
between blacks and whites, diminished interracial communi- 
cation, and  growth  of Negro  and white extremist groups. 

I. The Pattern of Violence and Damage 
Levels of Violence and Damage 

Because definitions of "civil disorder" vary widely, between 

1  and 217 disorders were recorded by various agencies as 

having occurred during the first nine months of 1967. From 

112 


these sources we have developed a list of 164 disorders which 
occurred during that period.1 We have ranked them in three 
categories of violence and damage utilizing such criteria as the 
degree and duration of violence, the number of active partici- 
pants, and the level of law enforcement respons'e: 

Major Disorders — Eight disorders, 5 percent of the total, 
were major. These were characterized generally by a combina- 
tion of the following factors: (1) many fires, intensive looting, 
and reports of sniping; (2) violence lasting more than two 
days; (3) sizeable crowds; and (4) use of National Guard or 
federal forces as well as other control forces.2 

Serious Disorders — Thirty-three disorders, 20 percent of the 
total, were serious but not major. These were characterized 
generally by: (1) isolated looting, some fires, and some rock 
throwing; (2) violence lasting between one and two days; 
(3) only one sizeable crowd or many small groups; and (4) use 
of state police though generally not National Guard or federal 
forces.3 

Minor Disorders — One hundred and twenty-three disorders, 
75 percent of the total, were minor. These would not have 
been classified as "riots" or received wide press attention with- 
out national conditioning to a "riot" climate. They were char- 
acterized generally by: (1) a few fires and broken windows; 
(2) violence lasting generally less than one day; (3) participa- 
tion by only small numbers of people; and (4) use, in most 
cases, only of local police or police from a neighboring com- 
munity.4 

The 164 disorders which we have categorized occurred in 
128 cities. Twenty-five (20 percent) of the cities had two or 
more disturbances. New York had five separate disorders, 
Chicago had four, six cities had three and 17 cities had two.5 
Two cities which experienced a major disorder — Cincinnati 
and Tampa — had subsequent disorders; Cincinnati had two 
more. However, in these two cities the later disorders were less 
serious than the earlier ones. In only two cities were later 
disorders more severe.6 

Three conclusions emerge from the data: 

• The significance of the 1967 disorders cannot be minimized. The 
level of disorder was major or serious, in terms of our criteria, 
on 41 occasions in 39 cities. 

• The level of disorder, however, has been exaggerated. Three- 
fourths of the disorders were relatively minor and would not have 
been regarded as nationally-newsworthy "riots" in prior years. 

• The fact that a city had experienced disorder earlier in 1967 
did not immunize it from further violence. 

113 


Distribution in Terms of Time, Area and Size of Community 

Time — In 1967, disorders occurred with increasing fre- 
quency as summer approached and tapered off as it waned. 
More than 60 percent of the 164 disorders occurred in July 
alone.

When timing and location are considered together, other 
relationships appear. Ninety-eight disorders can be grouped 
into 23 clusters, which consist of two or more disturbances 
occurring within two weeks and within a few hundred miles 
of each other. 

"Clustering" was particularly striking for two sets of cities. 
The first, centered on Newark, consisted of disorders in 14 
New Jersey cities. The second, centered on Detroit, consisted 
of disturbances in seven cities in Michigan and one in Ohio.9 

Size of Community — The violence was not limited to large 
cities. Seven of the eight major disorders occurred in com- 
munities with populations of 250,000 or more. But 37 (23 
percent) of the disorders reviewed occurred in communities 
with populations of 50,000 or less; and 67 disorders (41 per- 
cent) occurred in communities with populations of 100,000 

114 


or less, including nine (about 22 percent) of the 41 serious 
or major disturbances.

Death, Injury and Damage 

In its study of 75 disturbances in 67 cities, the Permanent 
Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on 
Government Operations reported 83 deaths and 1,897 
injuries.12 Deaths occurred in 12 of these disturbances. More 
than 80 percent of the deaths and more than half the injuries 
occurred in Newark and Detroit. In more than 60 percent of 
the disturbances, no deaths and no more than 10 injuries were 
reported.13 

Substantial damage to property also tended to be concen- 
trated in a relatively small number of cities. Of the disorders 
which the Commission surveyed, significant damage resulted 
in Detroit ($40-45 million), Newark ($10.2 million), and 
Cincinnati (more than $1 million). In each of nine cities, 
damage was estimated at less than $100,000.14 

Fire caused extensive damage in Detroit and Cincinnati, 
two of the three cities which suffered the greatest destruction 
of property.15 Newark had relatively little loss from fire but 
extensive inventory loss from looting and damage to stock.16 

Damage estimates made at the time of the Newark and 
Detroit disorders were later greatly reduced. Early estimates 
in Newark ranged from $15 to $25 million; a month later the 
estimate was revised to $10.2 million. In Detroit, newspaper 
damage estimates at first ranged from $200 million to $500 
million, the highest recent estimate is $45 million.17 

What we have said should not obscure three important fac- 
tors. First, the dollar cost of the disorders should be increased 
by the extraordinary administrative expenses of municipal, state 
and Federal governments.18 Second, deaths and injuries are not 
the sole measures of the cost of civil disorders in human terms. 
For example, the cost of dislocation of people — though clearly 
not quantifiable in dollars and cents — was a significant factor 
in Detroit, the one case in which many residences were de- 

115 


stroyed.19 Other human costs — fear, distrust, and alienation — 
were incurred in every disorder. Third, even a relatively low 
level of violence and damage in absolute terms may seriously 
disrupt a small or medium-sized community. 

Victims of Violence 

Of the 83 persons who died in the 75 disorders studied by 
the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, about 10 per- 
cent were public officials, primarily law officers and firemen. 
Among the injured, public officials made up 38 percent.20 The 
overwhelming majority of the civilians killed and injured 
were Negroes. 

Retail businesses suffered a much larger proportion of the 
damage during the disorders than public institutions, industrial 
properties, or private residences. In Newark, 1,029 establish- 
ments, affecting some 4,492 employers and employees, suffered 
damage to buildings or loss of inventory or both. Those which 
suffered the greatest loss through looting, in descending order 
of loss, were liquor, clothing, and furniture stores. 

White-owned businesses are widely believed to have been 
damaged much more frequently than those owned by Negroes. 
In at least nine of the cities studied, the damage seems to have 
been, at least in part, the result of deliberate attacks on white- 
owned businesses characterized in the Negro community as 
unfair or disrespectful toward Negroes.21 

Not all the listed damage was purposeful or was caused by 
rioters. Some was a by-product of violence. In certain in- 
stances police and fire department control efforts caused dam- 
age. The New Jersey commission on civil disorders has found 
that in Newark, retributive action was taken against Negro- 
owned property by control forces.22 Some damage was acci- 
dental. In Detroit some fire damage, especially to residences, 
may have been caused primarily by a heavy wind. 

Public institutions generally were not targets of serious at- 
tacks,23 but police and fire equipment was damaged in at least 
15 of the 23 cities.24 

Of the cities surveyed, significant damage to residences oc- 
curred only in Detroit. In at least nine of the 22 other cities 
there was minor damage to residences, often resulting from 
fares in adjacent businesses.25 

II. The Riot Process 

The Commission has found no "typical" disorder in 1967 
m terms of intensity of violence and extensiveness of damage, 
lo determine whether, as is sometimes suggested, there was a 
typical   not process," we examined 24 disorders which oc- 

116 


curred during 1967 in 20 cities and three university settings.26 
We have concentrated on four aspects of that process: 

• The accumulating reservoir of grievances in the Negro com- 
munity; 

• "Precipitating" incidents and their relationship to the reservoir of 
grievances; 

• The development of violence after its initial outbreak; 

• The control effort, including official force, negotiation, and per- 
suasion. 

We found a common social process operating in all 24 dis- 
orders in certain critical respects. These events developed simi- 
larly, over a period of time and out of an accumulation of 
grievances and increasing tension in the Negro community. 
Almost invariably, they exploded in ways related to the local 
community and its particular problems and conflicts. But once 
violence erupted, there began a complex interaction of many 
elements — rioters, official control forces, counter-rioters — in 
which the differences between various disorders were more 
pronounced than the similarities. 

The Reservoir of Grievances in the Negro Community 

Our examination of the background of the surveyed dis- 
orders revealed a typical pattern of deeply-held grievances 
which were widely shared by many members of the Negro 
community.27 The specific content of the expressed grievances 
varied somewhat from city to city. But in general, grievances 
among Negroes in all the cities related to prejudice, discrimina- 
tion, severely disadvantaged living conditions and a general 
sense of frustration about their inability to change those 
conditions. 

Specific events or incidents exemplified and reinforced the 
shared sense of grievance. News of such incidents spread 
quickly throughout the community and added to the reservoir. 
Grievances about police practices, unemployment and under- 
employment, housing and other objective conditions in the 
ghetto were aggravated in the minds of many Negroes by the 
inaction of municipal authorities. 

Out of this reservoir of grievance and frustration, the riot 
process began in the cities which we surveyed. 

Precipitating Incidents 

In virtually every case a single "triggering" or "precipitat- 
ing" incident can be identified as having immediately preceded 
— within a few hours and in generally the same location — the 
outbreak of disorder.28 But this incident was usually relatively 
minor, even trivial, by itself substantially disproportionate to 

117 


the scale of violence that followed. Often it was an incident of 
a type which had occurred frequently in the same community 
in the past without provoking violence. 

We found that violence was generated by an increasingly 
disturbed social atmosphere, in which typically not one, but 
a series of incidents occurred over a period of weeks or months 
prior to the outbreak of disorders.29 Most cities had three or 
more such incidents; Houston had 10 over a five-month period. 
These earlier or prior incidents were linked in the minds of 
many Negroes to the pre-existing reservoir of underlying griev- 
ances. With each such incident, frustration and tension grew 
until at some point a final incident, often similar to the inci- 
dents preceding it, occurred and was followed almost immedi- 
ately by violence. 

As we see it, the prior incidents and the reservoir of under- 
lying grievances contributed to a cumulative process of mount- 
ing tension that spilled over into violence when the final in- 
cident occurred. In this sense the entire chain — the grievances, 
the series of prior tension-heightening incidents, and the final 
incident — was the "precipitant" of disorder. 

This chain describes the central trend in the disorders we 
surveyed, and not necessarily all aspects of the riots or of all 
rioters. For example, incidents have not always increased 
tension; and tension has not always resulted in violence. We 
conclude only that both processes did occur in the disorders 
we examined. 

Similarly, we do not suggest that all rioters shared the con- 
ditions or the grievances of their Negro neighbors: some may 
deliberately have exploited the chaos created out of the frus- 
tration of others; some may have been drawn into the melee 
merely because they identified with, or wished to emulate, 
others. Some who shared the adverse conditions and grievances 
did not riot. 

We found that the majority of the rioters did share the ad- 
verse conditions and grievances. Although they did not neces- 
sarily articulate in their own minds the connection between 
that background and their actions. 

Newark and Detroit presented typical sequences of prior 
incidents, a build-up of tensions, a final incident, and the out- 
break of violence: 

NEWARK 

Prior Incidents 

1965: A Newark policeman shot and killed an 18-year-old Ne- 
gro boy. After the policeman had stated that he had fallen and 
nis gun had discharged accidentally, he later claimed that the 

118 


youth had assaulted another officer and was shot as he fled. At 
a hearing it was decided that the patrolman had not used excessive 
force. The patrolman remained on duty, and his occasional assign- 
ment to Negro areas was a continuing source of irritation in the 
Negro community: 

April, 1967: Approximately 15 Negroes were arrested while 
picketing a grocery store which they claimed sold bad meat and 
used unfair credit practices. 

Late May, early June: Negro leaders had for several months 
voiced strong opposition to a proposed medical-dental center 
to be built on 150 acres of land in the predominantly Negro Cen- 
tral Ward. The dispute centered mainly around the lack of relo- 
cation provisions for those who would be displaced by the medi- 
cal center. The issue became extremely volatile in late May when 
public "blight hearings" were held regarding the land to be con- 
demned: The hearings became a public forum in which many 
residents spoke against the proposed center. The city did not 
change its plan. 

Late May, June: The mayor recommended appointment of a 
white city councilman who had no more than a high school edu- 
cation to the position of secretary to the board of education. Re- 
portedly, there was widespread support from both whites and 
Negroes for a Negro candidate who held a master's degree and 
was considered more qualified. The mayor did not change his 
recommendation. Ultimately, the original secretary retained his 
position and neither candidate was appointed. 

July 8: Several Newark policemen, allegedly including the 
patrolman involved in the 1965 killing, entered East Orange to 
assist the East Orange police during an altercation with a group 
of Negro men. 
Final Incident 

July 12, approximately 9:30 p.m.: A Negro cab driver was 
injured during or after a traffic arrest in the heart of the Central 
Ward. Word spread quickly, and a crowd gathered in front of the 
Fourth Precinct station-house across the street from a large public 
housing project. 
Initial Violence 

Same day, approximately 11:30 p.m.: The crowd continued to 
grow until it reached 300 to 500 people. One or two Molotov 
cocktails were thrown at the station-house. Shortly after midnight 
the police dispersed the crowd, and window-breaking and looting 
began a few minutes later. By about 1:00 a.m., the peak level of 
violence for the first night was reached. 

DETROIT 

Prior Incidents 

August 1966: A crowd formed during a routine arrest of sev- 
eral Negro youths in the Kercheval section of the city. Tensions 
were high for several hours, but no serious violence occurred. 

June 1967: A Negro prostitute was shot to death on her front 
steps. Rumors in the Negro community attributed the killing to 
a vice squad officer. A police investigation later reportedly un- 
earthed leads to a disgruntled pimp. No arrests were made. 

119 


June 26: A young Negro man on a picnic was shot to death 
while reportedly trying to protect his pregnant wife from assault 
by seven white youths. The wife witnessed the slaying and mis- 
carried shortly thereafter. Of the white youths, only one was 
charged. The others were released. 

Final Incident 

July 23, approximately 3:45 a.m.: Police raided a "blind pig," 
a type of night club in the Negro area which served drinks after 
hours. Eighty persons were in the club — more than the police 
had anticipated — attending a party for several servicemen, two 
of whom had recently returned from Vietnam. A crowd of about 
200 persons gathered as the police escorted the patrons into 
the police wagons. 

Initial Violence 

Approximately 5:00 a.m.: As the last police cars drove away 
from the "blind pig," the crowd began to throw rocks. By 8:00 
a.m., looting had become widespread. Violence continued to in- 
crease throughout the day, and by evening reached a peak level 
for the first day. 

In the 24 disorders surveyed, the events identified as tension- 
heightening incidents, whether prior or final, involved issues 
which generally paralleled the grievances we found in these 
cities.30 The incidents identified were of the following types: 

POLICE  ACTIONS 

Some 40 percent of the prior incidents involved allegedly 
abusive or discriminatory police actions.31 Most of the police 
incidents began routinely and involved a response to, at most, 
a few persons rather than a large group.32 

A typical incident occurred in Bridgeton, New Jersey five 
days before the disturbance when two police officers went 
to the home of a young Negro man to investigate a nonsup- 
port complaint. A fight ensued when the officers attempted to 
take the man to the police station, and the Negro was criti- 
cally injured and partially paralyzed. A Negro minister rep- 
resenting the injured man's family asked for suspension of the 
two officers involved pending investigation. This procedure 
had been followed previously when three policemen were ac- 
cused of collusion in the robbery of a white-owned store. The 
Negro's request was not granted. 

Police actions were also identified as the final incident pre- 
ceding 12 of the 24 disturbances.33 Again, in all but two cases, 
the police action which became the final incident began rou- 
tinely."* 

The final incident in Grand Rapids occurred when police 
attempted to apprehend a Negro driving an allegedly stolen car. 

120 


A crowd of 30 to 40 Negro spectators gathered. The suspect 
had one arm in a cast, and some of the younger Negroes in 
the crowd intervened because they thought the police were 
handling him too roughly. 

PROTEST ACTIVITIES 

Approximately 22 percent of the prior incidents involved 
Negro demonstrations, rallies, and protest meetings.35 Only 
five involved appearances by nationally-known Negro mili- 
tants.36 

Protest rallies and meetings were also identified as the final 
incident preceding five disturbances. Nationally-known Negro 
militants spoke at two of these meetings; in the other three 
only local leaders were involved.37 A prior incident involving 
alleged police brutality was the principal subject of each of 
these three rallies.38 Inaction of municipal authorities was the 
topic for two other meetings.39 

WHITE RACIST ACTIVITIES 

About 17 percent of the prior incidents involved activities 
by whites intended to discredit or intimidate Negroes, or vio- 
lence by whites against Negroes.40 These included some 15 
cross-burnings in Bridgeton, the harassment of Negro college 
students by white teenagers in Jackson, Mississippi, and, in 
Detroit, the slaying of a Negro by a group of white youths. 
No final incidents were classifiable as racist activity. 

PREVIOUS DISORDERS IN THE SAME CITY 

In this category were approximately 16 percent of the prior 
incidents, including seven previous disorders, the handling of 
which had produced a continuing sense of grievance.41 There 
were other incidents, usually of minor violence, which oc- 
curred prior to seven disorders42 and were seen by the Negro 
community as precursors of the subsequent disturbance. Typi- 
cally, in Plainfield the night before the July disorder, a Negro 
youth was injured in an altercation between white and Negro 
teenagers. Tensions rose as a result. No final incidents were 
identified in this category. 

DISORDERS IN OTHER CITIES 

Local media coverage and rumors generated by the Newark 
and Detroit riots were specifically identified as prior incidents 

121 


in four cases.43 However, these major disorders appeared to 
be important factors in all the disorders which followed them. 
Media coverage and rumors generated by the major riots 
in nearby Newark and Plainfield were the only identifiable 
final incidents preceding five nearby disorders.44 In these cases 
there was a substantial mobilization of police and extensive 
patrolling of the ghetto area in anticipation of violence. 

OFFICIAL CITY ACTIONS 

Approximately 14 percent of the prior incidents were iden- 
tified as action, or in some cases, inaction of city officials other 
than police or the judiciary.45 Typically, in Cincinnati two 
months prior to the disturbance, approximately 200 representa- 
( mostly Negroes) of the inner-city community councils 
sought to appear before the city council to request summer 
recreation funds. The council permitted only one person from 
the group to speak, and then only briefly, on the ground that 
the group had not followed the proper procedure for placing 
the issue on the agenda. 

No final incidents were identified in this category. 

ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE 

Eight of the prior incidents involved cases of allegedly dis- 
criminatory administration of justice.46 Typical was a case in 
Houston a month and a half before the disorder. Three civil 
rights advocates were arrested for leading a protest and for 
their participation in organizing a boycott of classes at the 
predominantly Negro Texas Southern University. Bond was 
set at $25,000 each. The court refused for several days to 
reduce bond, even though TSU officials dropped the charges 
they had originally pressed. 

There were no final incidents identified involving the ad- 
ministration of justice. 

In a unique case, New Haven, the shooting of a Puerto 
Rican by a white man was identified as the final incident be- 
fore violence.47 

Finally, we have noted a marked relationship between prior 

and final incidents within each city. In most of the cities 

surveyed, the final incident was of the same type as one or 

e of the prior incidents. For example, police actions were 

identified as both the final incident and one or more prior 

incidents preceding seven disturbances.48 Rallies or meetings 

'otest police actions involved in a prior incident were iden- 

i as the final incident preceding three additional disturb- 

M.    rhe  cumulative  reinforcement  of  grievances  and 

122 


heightening of tensions found in all instances were particularly 
evident in these cases. 

The Development of Violence 

Once the series of precipitating incidents culminated in 
violence, the riot process followed no uniform pattern in the 
24 disorders surveyed.50 However, some similarities emerge. 

The final incident before the outbreak of disorder, and the 
initial violence itself, generally occurred at a time and place 
in which it was normal for many people to be on the streets. 
In most of the 24 disorders, groups generally estimated at 
50 or more persons were on the street at the time and place 
of the first outbreak.51 

In all 24 disturbances, including the three university-related 
disorders, the initial disturbance area consisted of streets with 
relatively high concentrations of pedestrian and automobile 
traffic at the time. In all but two cases — Detroit and Milwaukee 
— violence started between 7:00 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., when 
the largest numbers of pedestrians could be expected. Ten of 
the 24 disorders erupted on Friday night, Saturday or Sun- 
day.52 

In most instances, the temperature during the day on which 
violence first erupted was quite high.53 This contributed to the 
size of the crowds on the street, particularly in areas of con- 
gested housing. 

Major violence occurred in all 24 disorders during the 
evening and night hours, between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., 
and in most cases between 9:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m.54 In only 
a few disorders, including Detroit and Newark, did substantial 
violence occur or continue during the daytime.55 Generally, the 
night-day cycles continued in daily succession through the 
early period of the disorder.56 

At the beginning of disorder, violence generally flared al- 
most immediately after the final precipitating incident57 It 
then escalated quickly to its peak level, in the case of one-night 
disorders, and to the first night peak in the case of continuing 
disorders.58 In Detroit and Newark, the first outbreaks began 
within two hours and reached severe, although not the high- 
est, levels within three hours. 

In almost all of the subsequent night-day cycles, the change 
from relative order to a state of disorder by a number of peo- 
ple typically occurred extremely rapidly — within one or two 
hours at the most.59 

Nineteen of the surveyed disorders lasted more than one 
night.60 In 10 of these, violence peaked on the first night, and 

123 


the level of activity on subsequent nights was the same or 
less.61 In the other nine disorders, however, the peak was 
reached on a subsequent night.62 

Disorder generally began with less serious violence against 
property, such as rock and bottle throwing and window break- 
ing.63 These were usually the materials and the targets closest 
to hand at the place of the initial outbreak. 

Once store windows were broken, looting usually followed.64 
Whether fires were set only after looting occurred is unclear. 
Reported instances of fire-bombing and Molotov cocktails 
in the 24 disorders appeared to occur as frequently during one 
cycle of violence as during another in disorders which con- 
tinued through more than one cycle.65 However, fires seemed 
to break out more frequently during the middle cycles of riots 
lasting several days.66 Gunfire and sniping were also reported 
more frequently during the middle cycles.67 

The Control Effort 

What type of community response is most effective once 
disorder erupts is clearly a critically important question. Chap- 
ter 12, "Control of Disorder," and the Supplement on Control 
of Disorder to this report consider this question at length. 
We consider in this section the variety of control responses, 
official and unofficial, which were utilized in the 24 surveyed 
disorders, including: 

• Use or threatened use of local official force; 

• Use or threatened use of supplemental official force from other 
jurisdictions; 

• Negotiations between officials and representatives from the Negro 
community; 

• On-the-street persuasion by "counter-rioters." 

Disorders are sometimes discussed as if they consisted of a 
succession of confrontations and withdrawals by two cohesive 
groups, the police or other control force on one side and a 
riotous mob on the other. Often it is assumed that there was 
no effort within the Negro community to reduce the violence. 
Sometimes the only remedy prescribed is mobilization of the 
largest possible police or control force, as early as possible. 

None of these views are accurate. We found that: 

• A variety of different control forces employed a variety of tactics, 
often at the same time, and often in a confused situation; 

• Substantial non-force control efforts, such as negotiations and 
on-the-street persuasion by "counter-rioters," were usually under 
way, often simultaneously with forcible control efforts; counter- 

124 


rioter activity often was carried on by Negro residents of the 
disturbance  area,  sometimes  with  and  often  without official 
recognition; 
• No single tactic appeared to be effective in containing or reducing 
violence in all situations. 

LOCAL OFFICIAL FORCE 

In 20 of the 24 disorders, the primary effort to restore order 
at the beginning of violence was made entirely by local 
police.68 In 10 cases no additional outside force was called 
for after the initial response.69 In only a few cases was the 
initial control force faced with crowds too large to control.70 

The police approach to the initial outbreak of disorder in 
the surveyed cities was generally cautious.71 Three types of 
response were employed. One was dispersal (clearing the 
area, either by arrests or by scattering crowds), used in 10 
cases.72 Another was reconnaissance (observing and evaluating 
developments), used in eight cases.73 In half of these instances, 
they soon withdrew from the disturbance area, generally be- 
cause they believed they were unable to cope with the dis- 
order.74 The third was containment (preventing movement 
in or out of a cordoned or barricaded area), used in six 


cases 


75 


No uniform result from utilization of any of the three con- 
trol approaches is apparent. In at least half of the 24 cases 
it can reasonably be said that the approach taken by the police 
did not prevent the continuation of violence.76 To the extent 
that their effectiveness is measurable, the conclusion appears 
to hold for subsequent police control responses as well.77 
There is also evidence, in some instances, of over-response in 
subsequent cycles of violence.78 

The various tactical responses we have described are not 
mutually exclusive, and in many instances combinations were 
employed. The most common were attempts at dispersal in 
the disturbance area and a simultaneous cordon or barricade 
at the routes leading from the disturbance area to the central 
commercial area of the city, either to contain the disturbance 
or to prevent persons outside the area from entering it, or 
both.79 

In 11 disorders a curfew was imposed at some time, either 
as the major dispersal technique or in combination with other 
techniques.80 

In only four disorders was tear gas used at any point as a 
dispersal technique.81 

Only Newark and New Haven used a combination of all 
three means of control, cordon, curfew and tear gas.82 

125 


SUPPLEMENTAL OFFICIAL FORCE 

In nine disturbances — involving a wide variation in the 
intensity of violence — additional control forces were brought 
in after there had been serious violence which local police 
had been unable to handle alone.83 In every case further 
violence occurred, often more than once and often of equal 
or greater intensity than before.84 

The result was the same where extra forces were mobilized 
prior to serious violence. In four cities where this was done,85 
violence nonetheless occurred, in most cases more than once,86 
and often of equal or greater intensity than in the original out- 
break.87 

In the remaining group of seven cities no outside control 
forces were called,88 because the level and duration of violence 
were lower. Outbreaks in these cities nevertheless followed 
the same random pattern as in the cities which did use outside 
forces.89 

NEGOTIATION 

In 21 of the 24 disturbances surveyed, discussion or nego- 
tiation occurred during the disturbances. These took the form 
of relatively formal meetings between government officials and 
Negroes during which grievances and issues were discussed 
and means were sought to restore order.90 

Such meetings were usually held either immediately before 
or soon after the outbreak of violence.91 Meetings often con- 
tinued beyond the first or second day of the disorder and, in 
a few instances, through the entire period of the disorder.92 

The Negro participants in these meetings usually were es- 
tablished leaders in the Negro community, such as city coun- 
cilmen or members of human relations commissions, ministers, 
or officers of civil rights or other community organizations.93 
However, Negro youths were participants in over one-third 
of these meetings.94 In a few disorders both the youths and 
the adult Negro leaders participated,95 sometimes without the 
participation of local officials.96 

Employees of community action agencies occasionally par- 
ticipated, either as intermediaries or as participants. In some 
cases they provided the meeting place.97 

Discussions usually included issues generated by the dis- 
order itself, such as the treatment by the police of those ar- 
rested.98 In 12 cases, prior ghetto grievances, such as unem- 
ployment and inadequate recreational facilities, were included 

126 


as subjects." Often both disorder-related and prior grievances 
were discussed 10° with the focus generally shifting from the 
former to the latter as the disorder continued. 

How effective these meetings were is, as in the case of forci- 
ble response, impossible to gauge. Again, much depends on 
who participated, timing, and what other responses were being 
made at the same time. 

COUNTER-RIOTERS 

In all but six of the 24 disorders, Negro private citizens were 
active on the streets attempting to restore order primarily by 
means of persuasion.101 In a Detroit survey of riot area resi- 
dents over the age of 15, some 14 percent stated that they had 
been active as counter-rioters.102 

Counter-rioters sometimes had some form of official recog- 
nition from either the mayor or a human relations council.103 
Police reaction in these cases varied from total opposition to 
close cooperation.104 In most such cases some degree of offi- 
cial authorization was given before the activity of the counter- 
rioters began,105 and in a smaller number of cases, their ac- 
tivity was not explicitly authorized but merely condoned by 
the authorities.106 

Distinctive insignia were worn by the officially recognized 
counter-rioters in at least a few cities.107 In Dayton and Tam- 
pa, the white helmets issued to the counter-rioters have made 
the name "White Hats" synonymous with counter-rioters. 

Public attention has centered on the officially-recognized 
counter-rioters. However, counter-rioters are known to have 
acted independently, without official recognition, in a number 
of cities.108 

Counter-rioters generally included young men, ministers, 
community action agency and other anti-poverty workers and 
well-known ghetto residents.109 

Their usual technique was to walk through the disturbance 
area urging people to "cool it," although they often took other 
positive action as well, such as distributing food.110 

How effective the counter-rioters were is difficult to esti- 
mate. Authorities in several cities indicated that they believed 
they were helpful. 

III. The Riot Participant 

It is sometimes assumed that the rioters were criminal types, 
overactive social deviants, or riffraff — recent migrants, mem- 
bers of an uneducated underclass — alienated from responsible 

127 


Negroes, and without broad social or political concerns. It is 
often implied that there was no effort within the Negro com- 
munity to attempt to reduce the violence. 

We have obtained data on participation from four different 
sources.111 

• Eyewitness accounts, from more than 1,200 interviews in our 
staff reconnaissance survey of 20 cities; 

• Interview surveys based on probability samples of riot area resi- 
dents in the two major riot cities — Detroit and Newark — designed 
to elicit anonymous self -identification of participants as rioters, 
counter-rioters or non-involved; 

• Arrest records from 22 cities; 

• A special study of arrestees in Detroit. 

Only partial information is available on the total numbers of 
participants. In the Detroit survey, approximately 11 per- 
cent of the sampled residents over the age of 15 in the two 
disturbance areas admittedly participated in rioting; another 
20 to 25 percent admitted to having been bystanders but 
claimed that they had not participated; approximately 16 per- 
cent claimed they had engaged in counter-riot activity; and the 
largest proportion (48 to 53 percent) claimed they were at 
home or elsewhere and did not participate. However, a large 
proportion of the Negro community apparently believed that 
more was gained than lost through rioting, according to the 
Newark and Detroit surveys.112 

Greater precision is possible in describing the characteris- 
tics of those who participated. We have combined the data 
from the four sources to construct a profile of the typical 
rioter and to compare him with the counter-rioter and the 
noninvolved. 

The Profile of a Rioter 

The typical rioter in the summer of 1967 was a Negro, un- 
married male between the ages of 15 and 24. He was in many 
ways very different from the stereotype. He was not a migrant. 
He was born in the state and was a life-long resident of the city 
in which the riot took place. Economically his position was 
about the same as his Negro neighbors who did not actively 
participate in the riot. 

Although he had not, usually, graduated from high school, 
he was somewhat better educated than the average inner-city 
Negro, having at least attended high school for a time. 

Nevertheless, he was more likely to be working in a menial 
or low status job as an unskilled laborer. If he was employed, 

128 


he was not working full time and his employment was fre- 
quently interrupted by periods of unemployment. 

He feels strongly that he deserves a better job and that he 
is barred from achieving it, not because of lack of training, 
ability, or ambition, but because of discrimination by em- 
ployers. 

He rejects the white bigot's stereotype of the Negro as 
ignorant and shiftless. He takes great pride in his race and 
believes that in some respects Negroes are superior to whites. 
He is extremely hostile to whites, but his hostility is more 
apt to be a product of social and economic class than of race; 
he is almost equally hostile toward middle-class Negroes. 

He is substantially better informed about politics than Ne- 
groes who were not involved in the riots. He is more likely 
to be actively engaged in civil rights efforts, but is extremely 
distrustful of the political system and of political leaders. 

The Profile of the Counter-Rioter 

The typical counter-rioter, who risked injury and arrest to 
walk the streets urging rioters to "cool it," was an active sup- 
porter of existing social institutions. He was, for example, far 
more likely than either the rioter or the noninvolved to feel 
that this country is worth defending in a major war. His 
actions and his attitudes reflected his substantially greater 
stake in the social system; he was considerably better edu- 
cated and more affluent than either the rioter or the nonin- 
volved. He was somewhat more likely than the rioter, but less 
likely than the noninvolved, to have been a migrant. In all 
other respects he was identical to the noninvolved.113 

Characteristics of Participants 

Race — Eighty-three percent of the arrestees were Negroes; 
15 percent were whites.114 Our interviews in 20 cities indi- 
cate that almost all rioters were Negroes. 

Age — The survey data from Detroit, the arrest records, and 
our interviews in 20 cities, all indicate that the rioters were 
late teenagers or young adults.115 In the Detroit survey, 61.3 
percent of the self-reported rioters were between the ages of 
15 and 24, and 86.3 percent were between 15 and 35. The 
arrest data indicate that 52.5 percent of the arrestees were 
between 15 and 24, and 80.8 percent were between 15 and 35. 

Of the noninvolved, by contrast, only 22.6 percent in the 
Detroit survey were between 15 and 24, and 38.3 percent 
were between 15 and 35. 

129 


Sex — In the Detroit survey 61.4 percent of the self -reported 
rioters were male. Arrestees, however, were almost all male — 
89.3 percent.116 Our interviews in 20 cities indicate that the 
majority of rioters were male. The large difference in propor- 
tion between the Detroit survey data and the arrestee figures 
probably reflects either selectivity in the arrest process or less 
dramatic, less provocative riot behavior by women. 

Family Structure — Three sources of available information — 
the Newark survey, the Detroit arrest study, and arrest records 
from four cities — indicate a tendency for rioters to be single.117 
The Newark survey indicates that rioters were single — 56.2 
percent — more often than the noninvolved — 49.6 percent. 

The Newark survey also indicates that rioters were more 
likely to have been divorced or separated — 14.2 percent — than 
the noninvolved — 6.4 percent. However, the arrest records 
from four cities indicate that only a very small percentage of 
those arrested fall in this category. 

In regard to the structure of the family in which he was 
raised, the self-reported rioter, according to the Newark 
survey, was not significantly different from many of his Negro 
neighbors who did not actively participate in the riot. Twenty- 
five and five tenths percent of the self-reported rioters and 
23.0 percent of the noninvolved were brought up in homes 
where no adult male lived.118 

Region of Upbringing — Both survey data119 and arrest 
records120 demonstrate unequivocally that those brought up 
in the region in which the riot occurred are much more likely 
to have participated in the riots. The percentage of self-re- 
ported rioters brought up in the North is almost identical for 
the Detroit survey— 74.4 percent — and the Newark survey — 
74 percent. By contrast, of the noninvolved, 36 percent in 
Detroit and 52.4 percent in Newark were brought up in the 
region in which the disorder occurred.121 

Data available from five cities on the birthplace of ar- 
restees indicate that 63 percent of the arrestees were born 
in the North. Although birthplace is not necessarily identical 
with place of upbringing, the data are sufficiently similar to 
provide strong support for the conclusion. 

Of the self -reported counter-rioters, however, 47.5 percent 
were born in the North, according to the Detroit survey, a 
figure which places them between self -reported rioters and the 
noninvolved. Apparently, a significant consequence of growing 
up in the South is the tendency toward noninvolvement in a 
riot situation, while involvement in a riot, either in support of 
or against existing social institutions, was more common 
among those born in the North. 

Residence — Rioters are not only more likely than the non- 
130 


involved to have been born in the region in which the riot 
occurred, but they also more likely to have been long-term 
residents of the city in which the disturbance took place.122 
The Detroit survey data indicate that 59.4 percent of the self- 
reported rioters, but only 34.6 percent of the noninvolved, 
were born in Detroit. The comparable figures in' the Newark 
survey are 53.5 percent and 22.5 percent. 

Outsiders who temporarily entered the city during the riot 
might have left before the surveys were conducted and there- 
fore may be underestimated in the survey data. However, the 
arrest data,123 which is contemporaneous with the riot, sug- 
gest that few outsiders were involved: 90 percent of those 
arrested resided in the riot city. Seven percent lived in the 
same state. Only 1 percent were from outside the state. Our 
interviews in 20 cities also corroborate these conclusions. 

Income — In the Detroit and Newark survey data, income 
level alone does not seem to correlate with self-reported riot 
participation.124 The figures from the two cities are not directly 
comparable since respondents were asked for individual in- 
come in Detroit, and family income in Newark. More Detroit 
self -reported rioters (38.6 percent) had annual incomes under 
$5,000 per year than the noninvolved (30.3 percent), but even 
this small difference disappears when the factor of age is taken 
into account. 

In the Newark data, in which the age distributions of self- 
reported rioters and the noninvolved are more similar, there is 
almost no difference between the rioters, 32.6 percent of whom 
had annual incomes under $5,000, and the noninvolved, 29.4 
percent of whom had annual incomes under $5,000. 

The similarity in income distribution should not, however, 
lead to the conclusion that more affluent Negroes are as likely 
to riot as poor Negroes. Both surveys were conducted in dis- 
turbance areas in which incomes are considerably lower than 
in the city as a whole and the surrounding metropolitan 
area.125 Nevertheless, the data show that rioters are not neces- 
sarily the poorest of the poor. 

While income fails to distinguish self -reported rioters from 
those who were not involved, it does distinguish counter-rioters 
from rioters and the noninvolved. Less than 9 percent of both 
those who rioted and those not involved earned more than 
$10,000 annually. Yet almost 20 percent of the counter-rioters 
earned this amount or more. In fact, there were no male self- 
reported counter-rioters in the Detroit survey who earned less 
than $5,000 annually. In the Newark sample there were seven 
respondents who owned their own homes; none of them par- 
ticipated in the riot. While extreme poverty does not neces- 

131 


sarily move a man to riot, relative affluence seems at least to 
inhibit him from attacking the existing social order and may 
motivate him to take considerable risks to protect it. 

Education — Level of schooling is strongly related to partici- 
pation. Those with some high school education were more 
likely to riot than those who had only finished grade school.126 
In the Detroit survey 93 percent of the self-reported rioters 
had gone beyond grade school, compared with 72.1 percent 
of the noninvolved. In the Newark survey the comparable 
figures are 98.1 percent and 85.7 percent. The majority of 
self-reported rioters are not, however, high school graduates. 

The counter-rioters were clearly the best educated of the 
three groups. Approximately twice as many counter-rioters had 
attended college as had the noninvolved, and half again as 
many counter-rioters had attended college as rioters. Con- 
sidered with the information on income, this data suggests 
that counter-rioters were probably well on their way into the 
middle class. 

Education and income are the only factors which distinguish 
the counter-rioter from the noninvolved. Apparently, a high 
level of education and income not only prevents rioting but 
is more likely to lead to active, responsible opposition to 
rioting. 

Employment — The Detroit and Newark surveys, the arrest 
records from four cities, and the Detroit arrest study all indi- 
cate that there are no substantial differences in unemploy- 
ment between the rioters and the noninvolved.127 

Unemployment levels among both groups were extremely 
high. In the Detroit survey, 29.6 percent of the self-reported 
rioters were unemployed; in the Newark survey, 29.7 percent; 
in the four-city arrest data, 33.2 percent; and in the Detroit 
arrest study, 21.8 percent. The unemployment rates for the 
noninvolved in the Detroit and Newark surveys were 31.5 and 
19.0 percent. 

Self-reported rioters were more likely to be only intermit- 
tently employed, however, than the noninvolved. Respondents 
in Newark were asked whether they had been unemployed for 
as long as a month or more during the last year.128 Sixty-one 
percent of the self -reported rioters, but only 43.4 percent of 
the noninvolved, answered, "Yes." 

Despite generally higher levels of education, rioters are more 
likely than the noninvolved to be employed in unskilled 
jobs.129 In the Newark survey, 50.0 percent of the self-re- 
ported rioters, but only 39.6 percent of the noninvolved, had 
unskilled jobs. 

Attitudes About Employment — The Newark survey data in- 
dicate that self-reported rioters were more likely to feel dis- 

132 


satisfied with their present jobs than were the noninvolved.130 
Only 29.3 percent of the rioters, compared with 44.4 per- 
cent of the noninvolved, thought their present jobs to be 
appropriate for them in responsibility and pay. Of the self- 
reported rioters. 67.6 percent, compared with 56.1 percent of 
the noninvolved, felt that it was impossible to obtain the kind 
of job they wanted.131 Of the self-reported rioters, 69 percent, 
as compared with 50.0 percent of the noninvolved, felt that 
racial discrimination was the major obstacle to their finding 
better employment.132 Despite this feeling, surprising numbers 
of rioters, (76.9 percent) responded that "getting what you 
want out of life is a matter of ability, not being in the right 
place at the right time." 133 

Racial A ttitudes — The Detroit and Newark surveys indicate 
that rioters have strong feelings of racial pride, if not racial 
superiority.134 In the Detroit survey, 48.6 percent of the self- 
reported rioters said that they felt Negroes were more de- 
pendable than whites. Only 22.4 percent of the nonin.volved 
stated this. In Newark, the comparable figures were 45.0 and 
27.8 percent. The Newark survey data indicate that rioters 
want to be called "black" rather than "Negro" or "colored" 
and are somewhat more likely than the noninvolved to feel 
that all Negroes should study African history and languages.135 
To what extent this racial pride antedated the riot and to 
what extent it was produced by the riot is impossible to deter- 
mine from the survey data. Certainly the riot experience seems 
to have been associated with increased pride in the minds of 
many of the participants. This was vividly illustrated by the 
statement of a Detroit rioter: 

Interviewer: You said you were feeling good when you fol- 
lowed the crowds? 

Respondent: I was feeling proud, man, at the fact that I was 
a Negro. I felt like I was a first class citizen. I didn't feel ashamed 
of my race because of what they did. 

Similar feelings were expressed by an 18-year-old Detroit 
girl who reported that she had been a looter: 

Interviewer: What is the Negro then if he's not American? 

Respondent: A Negro, he's considered a slave to the white 
folks. But half of them know that they're slaves and feel that 
they can't do nothing about it because they're just going along 
with it. But most of them they seem to get it in their heads now 
how the white folks treat them and how they've been treating 
them and how they've been slaves for the white folks. . . . 

Along with increased racial pride there appears to be in- 
tense hostility toward whites.136 Self-reported rioters in both 
the Detroit and Newark surveys were more likely to feel that 

133 


civil rights groups with white and Negro leaders would do 
better without the whites. In Detroit, 36.1 percent of the self- 
reported rioters thought that this statement was true, while 
only 21.1 percent of the noninvolved thought so. In the 
Newark survey, 51.4 percent of the self-reported rioters 
agreed; 33.1 percent of the noninvolved shared this opinion. 

Self-reported rioters in Newark were also more likely to 
agree with the statement, "Sometimes I hate white people." 
Of the self-reported rioters, 72.4 percent agreed; of the non- 
involved, 50.0 percent agreed. 

The intensity of the self-reported rioters' racial feelings may 
suggest that the recent riots represented traditional interracial 
hostilities. Two sources of data suggest that this intepretation is 
probably incorrect. 

First, the Newark survey data indicate that rioters were 
almost as hostile to middle-class Negroes as they were to 
whites.137 Seventy-one and four-tenths percent of the self- 
reported rioters, but only 59.5 percent of the noninvolved, 
agreed with the statement, "Negroes who make a lot of money 
like to think they are better than other Negroes." Perhaps even 
more significant, particularly in light of the rioters' strong 
feelings of racial pride, is that 50.5 percent of the self-reported 
rioters agreed that "Negroes who make a lot of money are just 
as bad as white people." Only 35.2 percent of the noninvolved 
shared this opinion. 

Second, the arrest data show that the great majority of those 
arrested during the disorders were generally charged with a 
crime relating to looting or curfew violations.138 Only 2.4 per- 
cent of the arrests were for assault and 0.1 percent were for 
homicide, but 31.3 percent of the arrests were for breaking and 
entering — crimes directed against white property rather than 
against individual whites. 

Political Attitudes and Involvement — Respondents in the 
Newark survey were asked about relatively simple items of 
political information, such as the race of prominent local and 
national political figures. In general, the self-reported rioters 
were much better informed than the noninvolved.139 For exam- 
ple, self-reported rioters were more likely to know that one 
of the 1966 Newark mayoral candidates was a Negro. Of the 
rioters, 77.1 percent — but only 61.6 percent of the noninvolved 
— identified him correctly. The overall scores on a series of 
similar questions also reflect the self-reported rioters' higher 
levels of information. 

Self-reported rioters were also more likely to be involved 
in activities associated with Negro rights.140 At the most basic 
level of political participation, they were more likely than the 
noninvolved to talk frequently about Negro rights. In the New- 

134 


ark survey, 53.8 percent of the self -reported rioters, but only 
34.9 percent of the noninvolved, said that they talked about 
Negro rights nearly every day. 

The self -reported rioters also were more likely to have at- 
tended a meeting or participated in civil rights activity. Of the 
rioters, 39.3 percent — but only 25.7 percent of the nonin- 
volved— reported that they had engaged in such activity. 

In the Newark survey, respondents were asked how much 
they thought they could trust the local government.141 Only 
4.8 percent of the self -reported rioters, compared with 13.7 
percent of the noninvolved, said that they felt they could trust 
it most of the time; 44.2 percent of the self -reported rioters and 
33.9 percent of the noninvolved reported that they could al- 
most never trust the government. 

In the Detroit survey, self -reported rioters were much more 
likely to attribute the riot to anger about politicians and police 
than were the noninvolved.142 Of the self -reported rioters, 43.2 
percent — but only 19.6 percent of the noninvolved — said anger 
at politicians had a great deal to do with causing the riot. Of 
the self-reported rioters, 70.5 percent, compared with 48.8 
percent of the noninvolved, believed that anger at the police 
had a great deal to do with causing the riot. 

Perhaps the most revealing and disturbing measure of the 
rioters' anger at the social and political system was their re- 
sponse to a question asking whether they thought "the country 
was worth fighting for in the event of a major world war." 143 
Of the self-reported rioters, 39.4 percent in Detroit and 52.8 
percent in Newark shared a negative view. In contrast, 15.5 
percent of the noninvolved in Detroit and 27.8 percent of the 
noninvolved in Newark shared this sentiment. Almost none 
of the self -reported counter-rioters in Detroit — 3.3 percent — 
agreed with the self-reported rioters. 

Some comments of interviewees are worthy of note: 

Not worth fighting for — if Negroes had an equal chance it would 
be worth fighting for. 

Not worth fighting for — I am not a true citizen so why should 
I? 

Not worth fighting for — because my husband came back from 
Vietnam and nothing had changed. 

IV. The Background of Disorder 

In response to the President's questions to the Commission 
about the riot environment, we have gathered information on 
the pre-riot conditions in 20 of the cities surveyed.144 We have 
sought to analyze the backgrounds of the disorders in terms of 
four basic groupings of information: 

135 


• The social and economic conditions as described in the 1960 
census, with particular reference to the area of each city in which 
the disturbance took place; / 

• Local governmental structure and its organizational capacity to 
respond to the needs of the people, particularly those living in 
the most depressed conditions; 

• The extent to which federal programs assisted in meeting these 
needs; and 

• The nature of the grievances in the ghetto community. 

It is sometimes said that conditions for Negroes in the riot 
cities have improved over the years and are not materially dif- 
ferent from conditions for whites; that local government now 
seeks to accommodate the demands of Negroes and has created 
many mechanisms for redressing legitimate complaints; that 
federal programs now enable most Negroes who so desire, to 
live comfortably through welfare, housing, employment or 
anti-poverty assistance; and that grievances are harbored only 
by a few malcontents and agitators. 

Our findings show the contrary. In the riot cities we sur- 
veyed, we found that Negroes are severely disadvantaged, es- 
pecially as compared with whites; that local government is 
often unresponsive to this fact; that federal programs have 
not yet reached a significantly large proportion of those in 
need; and that these facts create a reservoir of unredressed 
grievances and frustration in the ghetto.145 

The Pattern of Disadvantage 

Social and economic conditions in the riot cities 146 con- 
stituted a clear pattern of severe disadvantage for Negroes as 
compared with whites, whether the Negroes lived in the dis- 
turbance area or outside it.147 When ghetto conditions are 
compared with those for whites in the suburbs, the relative 
disadvantage for Negroes is even greater. 

In all the cities surveyed, the Negro population increased 
between 1950 and 1960 at a median rate of 75 percent.148 

Meanwhile, the white population decreased in more than 
half the cities — including six which experienced the most se- 
vere disturbances in 1967. The increase in nonwhite popula- 
tion in four of these cities was so great that their total popula- 
tion increased despite the decrease in white population.149 
These changes were attributable in large part to heavy in- 
migration of Negroes from rural poverty areas and movement 
of whites from the central cities to the suburbs. 

In all the cities surveyed: 

• The percentage of Negro population in the disturbance area ex- 
ceeded the percentage of Negro population in the entire city. 

136 


In some cases it is twice, and in nine instances triple, the city-wide 
percentage.150 

• The Negro population was invariably younger than the white 
population.161 

• Negroes had completed fewer years of education and propor- 
tionately fewer had attended high school than whites.162 

• A larger percentage of Negroes than whites were in the labor 
force.168 

• Yet they were twice as likely to be unemployed as whites.164 

• In cities where they had greater opportunities to work at skilled 
or semi-skilled jobs, proportionately more Negro men tended to 
be working, or looking for work, than white men. Conversely, the 
proportion of men working, or looking for work, tended to be 
lower among Negroes than whites in cities that offered the least 
opportunities for skilled or semi-skilled labor.165 

• Among the employed, Negroes were more than three times as 
likely to be in unskilled and service jobs as whites.166 

• Negroes earned less than whites in all the surveyed cities, aver- 
aging barely 70 percent of white income, and were more than 
twice as likely to be living in poverty.167 

• A smaller proportion of Negro children than white children under 
18 were living with both parents.168 

• However, family "responsibility" was strongly related to oppor- 
tunity. In cities where the proportion of Negro men in better- 
than-menial jobs was higher, median Negro family income was 
higher, and the proportion of children under 18 living with both 
parents was also higher. Both family income and family structure 
showed greater weakness in cities where job opportunities were 
more restricted to unskilled jobs.168 

• Fewer Negroes than whites owned their own homes. Among non- 
home owners, Negroes paid the same rents, yet they paid a higher 
share of their incomes for rent than did whites. Although housing 
cost Negroes relatively more, their housing was three times as 
likely to be overcrowded and substandard as dwellings occupied 
by whites.160 

Local Governmental Structure 

In the riot cities surveyed, we found that: 

• All major forms of local government were represented. 

• In a substantial minority of instances, a combination of at-large 
election of legislators and a "weak-mayor" system resulted in. 
fragmentation of political responsibility and accountability. 

• The proportion of Negroes in government was substantially 
smaller than the Negro proportion of population. 

• Almost all the cities had a formal grievance machinery, but typi- 
cally it was regarded by most Negroes interviewed as ineffective, 
and generally ignored. 

All major forms of municipal government were represented 
in the 20 cities examined.161 Fourteen had a mayor-city coun- 

137 


cil form of government, five had a council-city manager, and 
one had a commission.162 

The division of power between the legislative and executive 
branches varied widely from city to city. Of the mayor-council 
cities, eight could be characterized as "strong mayor/weak 
city council" systems in the sense that the mayor had broad 
appointive and veto powers.163 Five could be characterized as 
"weak mayor/strong council" forms, where the city council 
had broad appointive and veto powers.164 In one city, Mil- 
waukee, such powers appeared to be evenly balanced.165 

In 17 of the 20 cities, mayors were elected directly.166 
Mayors were parttime in eight cities.167 Almost all the cities 
had a principal executive, either a mayor or a city manager, 
who earned a substantial annual salary.168 Terms of office for 
mayors ranged from two to four years.169 

In eight cities, all legislators were elected at large and there- 
fore represented no particular legislative ward or district.170 
Six of these cities also had either a city manager or a "weak- 
mayor" form of government. In these cases, there was heavy 
reliance upon the city council as the principal elected policy- 
making authority. This combination of factors appeared to 
produce even less identification by citizens with any par- 
ticular elected official than in the 12 cities which elected all 
legislators from wards or districts171 or used a combination 
of election by districts and at large.172 

The proportion of Negroes in the governments of the 20 
cities was substantially smaller than the median proportion of 
Negro population — 16 percent. Ten percent of the legislators 
in the surveyed cities were Negroes.173 Only in New Bruns- 
wick and Phoenix was the proportion of legislators who were 
Negroes as great as the percentage of the total population that 
was nonwhite. Six cities had no Negro legislators.174 Only 
three cities had more than one Negro legislator: Newark and 
Plainfield had two, and New Haven had five. None of the 
twenty cities had or had ever had a Negro mayor or city 
manager. In only four cities did Negroes hold other important 
policy-making positions or serve as heads of other municipal 
departments.175 In seven cities Negro representatives had been 
elected to the state legislature.176 

In 17 of the cities, however, Negroes were serving on boards 
of education.177 In all 17 cities which had human relations 
councils or similar organizations, Negroes were represented on 
the boards of such organizations. 

One of the most surprising findings is that in 17 of the 20 
surveyed riot cities, some formal grievance machinery existed 
prior to the 1967 disorders — a municipal human relations 

138 


council or similar organization authorized to receive citizen 
complaints about racial or other discrimination by public and 
private agencies.178 Existence of these formal channels, how- 
ever, did not necessarily achieve their tension-relieving pur- 
pose. They were seldom regarded as effective by Negroes who 
were interviewed. The councils generally consisted of promi- 
nent citizens, including one or more Negroes, serving part time 
and with little or no salary. 

With only one exception, the councils were wholly advisory 
and mediatory, with power to conciliate and make recommen- 
dations but not to subpoena witnesses or enforce compliance.179 
While most of the councils had full-time paid staff, they were 
generally organized only as loosely-affiliated departments of 
the city government.180 The number of complaints filed with 
the councils was low considering both the size of the Negro 
populations and the levels of grievance which the disorders 
manifested. Only five councils received more than 100 com- 
plaints a year.181 In almost all cases, complaints against pri- 
vate parties were mediated informally by these councils. But 
complaints against governmental agencies usually were re- 
ferred for investigation to the agencies against whom the com- 
plaints were directed. For example, complaints of police mis- 
conduct were accepted by most councils and then referred 
directly to the police for investigation. 

In only two cities did human relations councils attempt to 
investigate complaints against the police. In neither case did 
they succeed in completing the investigation.182 

Where special channels for complaints against the police 
existed, the result appears to have been similar. In several 
of the cities police-community relations units had been estab- 
lished within the police department, in most instances within 
two years prior to the disorder.183 However, complaints about 
police misconduct generally were forwarded to the police in- 
vestigative unit, complaint bureau or police chief for investi- 
gation. 

In all the cities which had a police-community relations unit, 
during the year preceding the disorder complaints against po- 
licemen had been filed with or forwarded to the police depart- 
ment.184 In at least two of these cities the police department 
stated that the complaints had been investigated and discipli- 
nary action taken in several cases.185 Whether or not these 
departments in fact did take action on the complaints, the 
results were never disclosed either to the public or to com- 
plainants. The grievances on which the complaints were based 
often appeared to remain alive. 

139 


Federal Programs 

What was the pattern of governmental effort to relieve 
ghetto conditions and respond to needs in the cities which 
experienced disorders in 1967? 

We have attempted no comprehensive answer to this large 
and complex question. Instead, we have surveyed only the key 
federal anti-poverty programs in Detroit, Newark and New 
Haven — cities which received substantial federal funds and 
also suffered severe disorders. 

Of the large number of federal programs to aid cities, we 
have concentrated on five types, which relate to the most 
serious conditions and which involve sizeable amounts of fed- 
eral assistance. We have sought to evaluate these amounts 
against the proportion of persons reached.186 

We conclude that: 

• While these three cities received substantial amounts of federal 
funds in 1967 for manpower, education, housing, welfare and 
community action programs, the number of persons assisted by 
those programs in almost all cases constituted only a fraction of 
those in need. 

• In at least 1 1 of the 15 programs examined (five programs in each 
of the three cities), the number of people assisted in 1967 was 
less than half of those in need. 

• In one of the 15 programs the percentage rose as high as 72 
percent. 

• The median was 33 percent. 

Manpower — Our study included all major manpower and 
employment programs including basic and remedial education, 
skill training, on-the-job training, job counseling, and place- 
ment.187 

A 1966 Department of Labor study of 10 slum areas, as well 
as our own survey of 20 disorder areas, indicate that under- 
employment may be an even more serious problem for ghetto 
residents than unemployment. However, our measurement of 
need for manpower programs is based on unemployment fig- 
ures alone because underemployment data are not available for 
the three cities surveyed. The Department of Labor estimates 
that underemployment rates in major central city ghettos are 
a multiple of the unemployment rate. 

In Detroit in the first three quarters of 1967, federal funds, 
obligated in the amount of $19.6 million, provided job train- 
ing opportunities for less than one-half of the unemployed. 

During the first nine months of 1967, the labor force in 

140 


Detroit totalled 650,000 persons, of whom 200,000 were Ne- 
groes. The average unemployment rate for that period was 
2.7 percent for whites and 9.6 percent for Negroes. The total 
average number unemployed during that period was 31,350* 
of whom 19,200 (61 percent) were Negroes. 

During the same period, there were 22 manpower programs 
(excluding MDTA institutional programs) in various stages of 
operation in Detroit. Twenty of the programs provided for 
13,979 trainees.188 

In Newark, in the first half of 1967, $2.6 million of federal 
funds provided job training opportunities for less than 20 per- 
cent of the unemployed.189 And in New Haven, during the first 
three quarters of 1967, federal funds in the amount of $2.1 
million provided job training opportunities for less than one- 
third of the unemployed.190 

Education — For purposes of comparing funding to needs, 
we have limited our examination to two major federal educa- 
tion programs for the disadvantaged: the Title I program under 
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) 
and the Adult Basic Education program. Title I provides as- 
sistance to schools haying concentrations of educationally 
disadvantaged children, defined as children from families hav- 
ing annual incomes of less than $3,000 or supported by the 
Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC). 
Title I supports remedial reading, career guidance for potential 
dropouts, reduced pupil-teacher ratios, special teacher train- 
ing, educational television and other teaching equipment, and 
specialized staff for social work, guidance and counseling, psy- 
chiatry and medicine. The Adult Basic Education program is 
designed to teach functionally illiterate adults to read. 

In order to measure the total federal contributions to state 
and local educational expenditures, we have also included such 
other federal programs as Head Start, for disadvantaged pre- 
school children; the larger institutional Manpower Develop- 
ment and Training Programs; the Teacher Corps; library ma- 
terial and supplementary education projects under Titles II and 
III of ESEA; and vocational education programs. 

In Detroit, during the 1967-68 school year, $11.2 million 
of ESEA Title I funds assist only 31 percent of the eligible 
students. Adult Basic Education reaches slightly more than 
2 percent of the eligible beneficiaries. Federal contributions 
to the Detroit public school system add about 10 percent to 
state and local expenditures.191 

In Newark, during the 1967-68 school year, $4 million of 
ESEA Title I funds assist about 72 percent of the eligible 
students. The number of persons reached by the Adult Basic 

141 


Education program is only approximately 6 percent of the 
number of functionally illiterate adults. Federal contributions 
to the Newark public school system add about 1 1 percent to 
state and local expenditures.192 

In New Haven, during the 1967-68 school year, ESEA 
Title 1 funds in the amount of $992,000 assist only 40 percent 
of the eligible students in the middle and senior high schools. 
Although all eligible beneficiaries in 14 targei elementary 
schools are aided, none of the eligible beneficiaries in 19 non- 
target elementary schools are reached. Adult Basic Education 
reaches less than 4 percent of eligible beneficiaries. Federal 
fontributions to the New Haven public school system add 
about 7 percent to state and local expenditures.193 

Housing — The major federal programs we have examined 
which are, at least in part, designed to affect the supply of 
low-income housing, include urban renewal, low rent public 
housing, housing for the elderly and handicapped, rent sup- 
plements, and FHA below market interest rate mortgage in- 
surance (BMIR). 

To measure the extent of need for low-income housing we 
have used the number of substandard and over-crowded 
units.194 In measuring the size of housing programs, we have 
included expenditures for years prior to 1967 because they 
affected the low-income housing supply available in 1967. 

In Detroit, a maximum of 758 low-income housing units 
have been assisted through these programs since 1956. This 
amounts to 2 percent of the substandard units and 1 .7 percent 
of the overcrowded units.195 Yet, since 1960, approximately 
8,000 low income units have been demolished for urban 
renewal. 

Similarly, in Newark, since 1959, a maximum of 3,760 
low-income housing units have been assisted through the pro- 
grams considered. This amounts to 16 percent of the sub- 
standard units and 23 percent of the overcrowded units.196 
During the same period, more than 12,000 families, mostly 
low-income, have been displaced by such public uses as urban 
renewal, public housing and highways. 

In New Haven, since 1952, a maximum of 951 low-income 
housing units have been assisted through the programs con- 
sidered. This amounts to 14 percent of the substandard units 
and 20 percent of the overcrowded units.197 Yet since 1956, 
approximately 6,500 housing units, mostly low-income, have 
been demolished for highway construction and urban renewal. 

Welfare — We have considered four federally-assisted pro- 
grams which provide monetary benefits to low-income persons: 
Old Age Assistance, Aid to the Blind, Aid to the Permanently 

142 


and Totally Disabled, and Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children (AFDC).198 

In Detroit, the number of persons reached with $48.2 mil- 
lion of federal funds through the four welfare programs during 
fiscal year 1967 was approximately 19 percent of the number 
of poor persons.199 In Newark, the number of persons reached 
with $15 million was approximately 54 percent.200 In New 
Haven, the number reached with $3.9 million was approxi- 
mately 40 percent.201 

Community Action Programs — We have considered such 
community action programs as neighborhood service centers, 
consumer education, family counseling, low-cost credit serv- 
ices, small business development, legal services, programs for 
the aged, summer programs, home economics counseling, and 
cultural programs.202 

In Detroit, the number of persons reached by $12.6 million 
of community action funds in 1967 was only about 30 percent 
of the number of poor persons. Federal funding of these pro- 
grams averaged approximately $35 for each poor person.203 
In Newark, the number of persons reached by $1.9 million 
was about 44 percent. Federal funding of these programs 
averaged approximately $21 for each poor person.204 In New 
Haven, the number reached by $2.3 million was approxi- 
mately 42 percent. Federal funding averaged approximately 
$72 for each poor person.205 

Grievances 

To measure the present attitudes of people in the riot cities 
as precisely as possible, we are sponsoring two attitude surveys 
among Negroes and whites in 15 cities and four suburban 
areas, including four of the 20 cities studied for this chapter. 
These surveys are to be reported later. 

In the interim we have attempted to draw some tentative 
conclusions based upon our own investigations and the more 
than 1200 interviews which we conducted relatively soon after 
the disorders.206 

In almost all the cities surveyed, we found the same major 
grievance topics among Negro communities — although they 
varied in importance from city to city. The deepest grievances 
can be ranked into the following three levels of relative in- 
tensity: 

First Level of Intensity 

1. Police practices 

2. Unemployment and underemployment 

3. Inadequate housing 

143 


Second Level of Intensity 

4. Inadequate education ^ 

5. Poor recreation facilities and programs "■ 

6. Ineffectiveness  of  the  political  structure  and  grievance 
mechanisms 

Third Level of Intensity 

7. Disrespectful white attitudes 

8. Discriminatory administration of justice 

9. Inadequacy of federal programs 

10. Inadequacy of municipal services ^ 

11. Discriminatory consumer and credit practices ao 

12. Inadequate welfare programs 

Our conclusions for the 20 cities have been generally con- 
firmed by a special interview survey in Detroit sponsored by 
the Detroit Urban League. 211 

Police practices were, in some form, a significant grievance 
in virtually all cities and were often one of the most serious 
complaints.212 Included in this category were complaints about 
physical or verbal abuse of Negro citizens by police officers, 
the lack of adequate channels for complaints against police, 
discriminatory police employment and promotion practices, 
a general lack of respect for Negroes by police officers, and 
the failure of police departments to provide adequate protec- 
tion for Negroes. 

Unemployment and underemployment were found to be 
grievances in all 20 cities and also frequently appeared to be 
one of the most serious complaints.213 These were expressed 
in terms of joblessness or inadequate jobs and discriminatory 
practices by labor unions, local and state governments, state 
employment services and private employment agencies. 

Housing grievances were found in almost all of the cities 
studied and appeared to be one of the most serious complaints 
in a majority of them.214 These included inadequate enforce- 
ment of building and safety codes, discrimination in sales 
and rentals, and overcrowding. 

The educational system was a source of grievance in almost 
all the 20 cities and appeared to be one of the most serious 
complaints in half of them.215 These grievances centered on 
the prevalence of de facto segregation, the poor quality of in- 
struction and facilities, deficiencies in the curriculum in the 
public schools (particularly because no Negro history was 
taught), inadequate representation of Negroes on school 
boards, and the absence or inadequacy of vocational training. 

Grievances concerning municipal recreation programs were 
found in a large majority of the 20 cities and appeared to be 
one of the most serious complaints in almost half.216 Inade- 

144 


quate recreational facilities in the ghetto and the lack of 
organized programs were common complaints. 

The political structure was a source of grievance in almost 
all of the cities and was one of the most serious complaints 
in several.217 There were significant grievances concerning the 
lack of adequate representation of Negroes in, the political 
structure, the failure of local political structures to respond 
to legitimate complaints and the absence of obscurity of offi- 
cial grievance channels. 

Hostile or racist attitudes of whites toward Negroes ap- 
peared to be one of the most serious complaints in several 
cities.218 

In three-quarters of the cities there were significant griev- 
ances growing out of beliefs that the courts administer justice 
on a double, discriminatory standard, and that a presumption 
of guilt attaches whenever a policeman testifies against a 
Negro.219 

Significant grievances concerning federal programs were 
expressed in a large majority of the 20 cities, but appeared to 
be one of the most serious complaints in only one.220 Criticism 
of the federal anti-poverty programs focused on insufficient 
participation by the poor, lack of continuity, and inadequate 
funding. Other significant grievances involved urban renewal, 
insufficient community participation in planning and decision- 
making, and inadequate employment programs. 

Services provided by municipal governments — sanitation 
and garbage removal, health and hospital facilities, and paving 
and lighting of streets — were sources of complaint in approxi- 
mately half of the cities, but appeared to be one of the most 
serious grievances in only one.221 

Grievances concerning unfair commercial practices affecting 
Negro consumers were found in approximately half of the 
cities, but appeared to be one of the most serious complaints 
in only two.222 Beliefs were expressed that Negroes are sold 
inferior quality goods (particularly meats and produce) at 
higher prices and are subjected to excessive interest rates and 
fraudulent commercial practices. 

Grievances relating to the welfare system were expressed 
in more than half of the 20 cities, but were not among the most 
serious complaints in any of the cities. There were complaints 
related to the inadequacy of welfare payments, "unfair regu- 
lations," such as the "man in the house" rule, which governs 
welfare eligibility, and the sometimes hostile and contemptuous 
attitude of welfare workers. The Commission's recommenda- 
tions for reform of the welfare system are based on the neces- 
sity of attacking the cycle of poverty and dependency in the 
ghetto.

V. The Aftermath of Disorder 

"We will all do our best for a 
peaceful future together." 

"Next time we'll really get the so 
and so's." 

"It won't happen again." 

"Nothing much changed here— one 
way or the other." 

We have sought to determine whether any of these ex- 
pressions accurately characterizes events in the immediate 
aftermath of the 20 surveyed disorders. We are conducting 
continuing studies of the post-disorder climate in a number of 
cities.223 But we have tried to make a preliminary judgment 
at this point. To do so, we considered: 

• Changes in Negro and white organizations; 

• Official and civic responses to the social and economic conditions 
and grievances underlying the disorders; 

• Police efforts to increase capacity to control future outbreaks; 

• Efforts to repair physical damage. 

We conclude that: 

• The most common reaction was characterized by the last of the 
quoted expressions — "nothing much changed"; 

• The status quo of daily life before the disorder was quickly re- 
stored; 

• Despite some notable public and private efforts, particularly re- 
garding employment opportunities, little basic change took place 
in the conditions underlying the disorder; 

• In some cities disorder recurred within the same summer; ^ 

• In several cities, the principal official response was to train and 
equip the police and auxiliary law enforcement agencies with 
more sophisticated weapons; 

• In several cities, Negro communities sought to develop greater 
unity to negotiate with the larger community and to initiate self- 
help efforts in the ghetto; 

• In several cities, there has been increased distrust between blacks 
and whites, less interracial communication, and growth of white 
segregationist or black separatist groups. 

Often several of these developments occurred simultaneously 
within a city. 

151 


Detroit provides a notable example of the complexity of 
post-disorder events. Shortly after the riot, many efforts to 
ameliorate the grievances of ghetto residents and improve in- 
terracial communication were announced and begun by public 
and private organizations. The success of these efforts and 
their reception by the Negro community were mixed. More 
recently, militant separatist organizations of both races appear 
to be growing in influence. 

Some of the most significant of the post-riot developments 
were: 

Official and Other Community Actions 

The New Detroit Committee (NDC), organized under the co- 
sponsorship of the Mayor of Detroit and the Governor of Michi- 
gan, originally had a membership ranging from top industrialists 
to leading black militant spokesmen. NDC was envisioned as 
the central planning body for Detroit's rejuvenation. 

However, it had an early setback last fall when the state legis- 
lature rejected its proposals for a statewide fair housing ordinance 
and for more state aid for Detroit's schools. 

In January, 1968 NDC's broad interracial base was seriously 
weakened when black militant members resigned in a dispute 
over the conditions set for a proposed NDC-supported grant of 
$100,000 to a black militant organization. 

To deal with the employment problem, the Ford Motor Com- 
pany and other major employers in Detroit promised several 
thousand additional jobs to Detroit's hard-core unemployed. At 
least 55,000 persons were hired by some 17 firms. Ford, for ex- 
ample, established two employment offices in the ghetto. Reports 
vary on the results of these programs. 

Steps taken to improve education after the riot include the ap- 
pointment of Negroes to seven out of eighteen supervisory posi- 
tions in the Detroit school system. Before the summer of 1967 
none of these positions was held by a Negro. Michigan Bell Tele- 
phone Company announced that it would "adopt" one of De- 
troit's public high schools and initiate special programs in it. 

Detroit's school board failed to obtain increased aid from the 
state legislature and announced plans to bring a novel suit against 
the state to force higher per capita aid to ghetto schools. 

There are signs of increased hostility toward Negroes in the 
white community. One white extremist organization reportedly 
proposes that whites arm themselves for the holocaust it proph- 
esies. A movement to recall the mayor has gained strength since 
the riot, and its leader has also pressed to have the fair housing 
ordinance passed by the Detroit Common Council put to a 
referendum. 

The police and other law enforcement agencies in Detroit are 
making extensive plans to cope with any future disorder. The 
mayor has proposed to the Common Council the purchase of 
some $2 million worth of police riot equipment, including tanks, 
armored personnel carriers, and Stoner rifles (a weapon which 
fires a particularly destructive type of bullet). 

152 


Negro Community Action 

A broadly-based Negro organization, the City-Wide Citizens 
Action Committee (CCAC), was formed after the riot by a lead- 
ing local militant and originally included both militant and mod- 
erate members. It stresses self-determination for the black com- 
munity. For example, it is developing plans for Negro-owned 
cooperatives and reportedly has demanded Negro participation in 
planning new construction in the ghetto. CCAC lost some of its 
moderate members because it has taken increasingly militant 
positions, and a rival, more moderate Negro organization, the 
Detroit Council of Organizations, has been formed. 

Post-Riot Incidents and Prospects for the Future 

There appears to be a growing division between the black and 
white communities as well as within the black community itself. 
Some pawnshops and gun stores have been robbed of firearms, 
and gun sales reportedly have tripled since the riot. In late 1967 
a rent strike took place, some fire bombings were reported and a 
new junior high school was seriously damaged by its predom- 
inantly Negro student body. 

Many Negroes interviewed rejected the theory that the 1967 
riot immunized Detroit against further disorders, Some believed 
that a new disturbance may well be highly organized and there- 
fore much more serious. 

Changes in Negro and White Organizations 

In half the cities surveyed, new organizations concerned 
with race relations were established or old ones revitalized. 
No clear trend is apparent. 

In a few cities the only apparent changes have been the 
increased influence of Negro militant separatist or white seg- 
regationist groups.225 

In a few cities the organizations identified tended to follow 
more moderate and integrationist policies.226 A youthful Negro 
who emerged as a leader during the riot in Plainfield started 
a new organization which, though militant, is cooperating with 
and influencing the established, more moderate Negro leader- 
ship in the city. 

And in a few cities, organizations of white segregationists, 
Negro militants and moderate integrationists all emerged fol- 
lowing the disturbances. In Newark, as in Detroit, both black 
and white extremist organizations have been active, as well as 
a prominent integrationist post-riot organization, the Commit- 
tee of Concern. The committee was formed immediately after 
the riot and includes leading white businessmen, educators and 
Negro leaders. At the same time, leading black militants re- 

153 


portedly gained support among Negro moderates. And a white 
extremist group achieved prominence — but not success — in at- 
tempting to persuade the city council to authorize the purchase 
of police dogs.227 

Official and Civic Response 

Actions to ameliorate Negro grievances in the 20 cities 
surveyed were limited and sporadic. With few exceptions, these 
actions cannot be said to have contributed significantly to 
reducing the level of tension. 

POLICE-COMMUNITY  RELATIONS 

In eight of the cities surveyed municipal administrations 
took some action to strengthen police-community relations.228 
In Atlanta, immediately after the riot, residents of the dis- 
turbance area requested that all regular police patrols be with- 
drawn because of hostility caused during the riot, when a resi- 
dent was killed allegedly by policemen. The request was 
granted, and for a time the only officers in the area were 
police-community relations personnel. In Cincinnati, however, 
a proposal to increase the size of the police-community rela- 
tions unit and to station the new officers in precinct stations 
has received little support. 

EMPLOYMENT 

Public and private organizations, often including business 
and industry, made efforts to improve employment oppor- 
tunities in nine of the cities.229 

In Tucson, a joint effort by public agencies and private 
industry produced 125 private and 75 city jobs. Since most 
of the city jobs ended with with the summer, some companies 
sought to provide permanent employment for some of those 
who had been hired by the city. 

HOUSING 

In nine cities surveyed, municipal administrations increased 
their housing programs.230 In Cambridge, the Community Re- 
lations Commission supported the application of a local church 
to obtain federal funds for low and moderate income housing. 
The Commission also tried to interest local and national build- 
ers in constructing additional low-cost housing. 

The Dayton city government initiated a program of con- 
centrated housing code enforcement in the ghetto. The housing 

154 


authority also adopted a policy of dispersing public housing 
sites and, at the request of Negroes, declared a moratorium 
on any new public housing in the predominantly Negro West 
Dayton area. 

But in Newark, municipal and state authorities continued to 
pursue a medical center project designed to occupy up to 
150 acres in the almost all-Negro Central Ward. The project, 
bitterly opposed by Negroes before the riot, would have re- 
quired massive relocation of Negroes and was a source of 
great tension in the Negro community. However, with the 
persistent efforts of federal officials (HUD and HEW), an 
accommodation appears to have been reached on the issue 
recently, with reduction of the site to approximately 58 acres. 

Private organizations attempted to improve the quality of 
ghetto housing in at least three of the cities surveyed. A Cath- 
olic charity in New Jersey announced a plan to build or re- 
habilitate 100 homes in each of five cities, including three of 
the cities surveyed (Elizabeth, Jersey City and Newark) and 
to sell the homes to low-income residents. The plan received 
substantial business backing.231 

EDUCATION 

In five of the cities surveyed, local governments have taken 
positive steps to alleviate grievances relating to education.232 
In Rockford, residents approved a bond referendum to in- 
crease teacher salaries, build schools and meet other needs. 
A portion of this money will be used, with matching state and 
federal funds, to construct a vocational and technical center 
for secondary schools in the Rockford area. 

In two cities, private companies made substantial contribu- 
tions to local school systems. The Standard Oil Company of 
New Jersey donated to the Elizabeth school board a building 
valued at $500,000 for use as an administrative center and 
for additional classrooms.233 

In four of the cities surveyed, grievances concerning edu- 
cation increased.234 In Cincinnati recent elections resulted 
in the seating of two new board of education members who 
belonged to a taxpayers' group which had twice in 1966 
successfully opposed a school bond referendum. Also, racial 
incidents in the Cincinnati schools increased dramatically in 
number and severity during the school year. 

RECREATION 

In four cities, programs have been initiated to increase 
recreational facilities in ghetto communities.235 A month and 

155 


a half after the New Brunswick disturbance, local business- 
men donated five portable swimming pools to the city. A boat 
which the city will use as a recreation center was also donated 
and towed to the city by private companies. 

NEGRO REPRESENTATION 

The elections of Negro mayors in Cleveland — which ex- 
perienced the Hough riot in 1966 — and Gary have been widely 
interpreted as significant gains in Negro representation and 
participation in municipal political structures. In five of the 
six surveyed cities which have had municipal elections since 
the 1967 disturbances, however, there has been no change in 
Negro representation in city hall or in the municipal govern- 
ing body.236 In New Haven, the one city where there was 
change, the result was decreased Negro representation on the 
board of aldermen from five out of 35 to three out of 30. 

Changes toward greater Negro representation occurred in 
three other cities in which Negroes were selected as president 
of the city council and as members of a local civil service 
commission, a housing authority and a board of adjust- 
ments.237 

GRIEVANCE MACHINERY 

There was a positive change in governmental grievance 
channels or procedures in two cities.238 But in one case, an 
effort to continue use of counter-rioters as a communications 
channel was abandoned.239 

FEDERAL PROGRAMS 

There are at least ten examples, in eight cities, of federal 
programs being improved or new federal programs being 
instituted240; in two cities disputes have arisen in connection 
with federally-assisted programs.241 

MUNICIPAL  SERVICES 

Four cities have tried to improve municipal services in dis- 
turbance areas.242 In Dayton, the city began a program of 
additional garbage collection and alley cleaning in the dis- 
turbance area. In Atlanta, on the day after the disturbance 
ended, the city began replacing street lights, repaving streets 
and collecting garbage frequently in the disturbance area. 
However, the improved services were reportedly discontinued 
after a month and a half. 

156 


OTHER  PROGRAMS 

In one city, a consumer education program was begun.243 
In none of the 20 cities surveyed were steps taken to improve 
welfare programs. In two of the surveyed cities, plans were 
developed to establish new businesses in disturbance areas.244 

Capacity to Control Future Disorders 

Five of the surveyed cities planned to improve police con- 
trol capability in the event of disorder.245 Four cities developed 
plans for using counter-rioters,240 but in one case the plans 
were later abandoned.247 In Detroit, plans were made to im- 
prove the administration of justice in the event of future dis- 
order by identifying usable detention facilities and assigning 
experienced clerks to process arrestees. 

Repair of Physical Damage 

Significant numbers of businessmen in the riot areas have 
reopened in several cities where damage was substantial. In 
Detroit, none of the businesses totally destroyed in the riot 
have been rebuilt, but many which suffered only minor dam- 
age have reopened. In Newark, 83 percent of the damaged 
businesses have reopened, according to official estimates.248 In 
Detroit, the only city surveyed which suffered substantial dam- 
age to residences, there has been no significant residential 
rebuilding. 

In two cities, Negro organizations insisted on an active role 
in decisions about rehabilitation of the disturbance area.249

Notes to Chapter 2 

In many of these footnotes where a series of disorders is 
mentioned we have indicated the number of disturbances which 
have been classified as "major," "serious" or "minor" in the 
section on "Levels of Violence and Damage" in Chapter 2-1 
supra.

The causal relationship between the Detroit and Newark riots and the 
disorders in their respective clusters is considered under Precipitating 
Incidents in Part II of this chapter. 

The other 21 clusters, arranged by the month in which each cluster began' 
were: 

April: — Cleveland, Massillon 

— Nashville, Louisville 

May: — San Francisco, Vallejo 

June: — Cincinnati, Dayton, Middletown

10. This table is based upon the estimated 1967 population of the 128 cities 
except for New York and Hartford, for which 1966 estimates were used, 
and 15 cities for which 1960 census figures were used (Deerfield Beach, 
East Orange, Englewood, Irvington, Lackawanna, Maywood, Montclair, 
Orange, Prattville, Rahway, Riviera Beach, Seaford, Spring Valley, 
Wadesboro and Waterloo). 

11. Figures were unavailable for four communities (East Palo Alto, Jamesburg, 
Marin City and Wyandanch). 

12. See Hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the 
Senate Committee on Government Operations, Riots , Civil and Criminal 
Disorders, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., Part I, insert facing p. 14. 

More recent data indicate that there were 23 riot-related deaths in Newark 
rather than 25 as reported by the Subcommittee. There are similiar varia- 
tions for some cities with regard to the number injured. In addition, Atlanta, 
in which there was one death and at least nine injuries, was not included in 
the Subcommittee's list. Finally, two of the disturbances included in the 
Subcommittee's figures are not in our list of 164 disorders (Hattiesburg, 
Miss. — no deaths, five injuries; Montgomery, Ala. — no deaths, no injuries). 

13. In 12 (16 percent) of the disturbances studied by the Permanent Subcom- 
mittee there were deaths. Sixty-eight (82 percent) of the deaths and 1,049 
(55 percent) of the injuries occurred in two (3 percent) of the disturbances. 

According to figures of the Permanent Subcommittee, Detroit experienced 
43 deaths and 324 injuries; Newark experienced 25 deaths and 725 injuries. 

In six (8 percent) of the disturbances, there were one to four deaths and 
11 to 65 injuries reported:

15. The Detroit Fire Department has listed 682 riot-connected building fires. 
Of these, 412 buildings were completely demolished. The Cincinnati Fire 
Department has estimated over $1 million in damage from riot-connected 
fires during the June disturbance. 

16. Of 250 fires during a six-day period, only 13 were considered serious by 
Newark authorities. In no case did a fire spread from its original source to 
other areas. 

More than $8 million of the loss in Newark was attributed to loss of in- 
ventory due to looting and damage to stock. Of the 889 business establish- 
ments damaged, 25 (3 percent) were demolished and 136 (15 percent) 
were heavily damaged. Damage to glass, fixtures and buildings was esti- 
mated at $1,976,140. 

17. On August 15, 1967, it was reported that the State Insurance Commission 
estimated the property loss at $144 million and that the Detroit Fire 
Department's estimate was closer to $200 million, only $84 million of which 
was insured. A December, 1967, estimate by the State Insurance Com- 
mission was between $40 million and $45 million. The Insurance Commis- 
sion indicated that almost $33 million will be covered by insurance. 

18. The City of Detroit incurred over $5 million in extraordinary expenses, 
more than $3 million of which was for personnel costs. In Cincinnati, a 
disorder of one week cost three city departments more than $300,000 in 
extraordinary expenditures, principally for overtime for police and firemen. 

19. In Detroit at least 274 families were displaced by the destruction of their 
homes. 

20. Seventy-four (89 percent) of the persons reported killed were civilians. The 
person killed in Atlanta was also a civilian. Of the 1,897 persons reported 
injured 1,185 (62 percent) were civilians and 712 (38 percent) were public 
officials. There is evidence that many additional injuries to civilians were 
not reported to officials.

22. The New Jersey Commission said: 

The damage caused within a few hours early Sunday morning, July 16, 
to a large number of stores marked with "Soul" signs to depict non-white 
ownership and located in a limited area reflects a pattern of police action 
for which there is no possible justification. Testimony strongly suggests 
that State Police elements were mainly responsible with some participa- 
tion by National Guardsmen. 

Governor's Select Commission on Civil Disorder, State of New Jersey, 

Report for Action, February 1968, p. 304. 

23. In at least three of the cities (Detroit, Newark and Plainfield) there was 
damage to police and /or fire stations. In Cambridge, a public elementary 
school building was burned. In two of the university settmgs, school build- 
ings were damaged. There was extensive damage to two dormitories at 
Texas Southern University in Houston. The bulk of this damage was 
allegedly caused by police gunfire and subsequent searches of the buildings. 
At privately-owned Fisk University in Nashville, a plate glass door was 
broken. It is unclear whether this was done by police or students.

26. The 20 cities were Atlanta, Bridgeton, Cambridge, Cincinnati (the June 
disorder), Dayton (the June and September disorders), Detroit, Elizabeth, 
Englewood. Grand Rapids, Jersey City, Milwaukee, New Brunswick, 
Newark, New Haven, Paterson, Phoenix, Plainfield, Rockford, Tampa 
and Tucson. 

The three university settings were Houston, Texas (Texas Southern Uni- 
versity),  Jackson,  Mississippi  (Jackson  State  College)  and  Nashville, 
Tennessee (Fisk University and Tennessee A. & I. State College). 
See Statement on Methodology, Appendix, for a description of our survey 
procedures. 

27. See Part IV, THE BACKGROUND OF DISORDER, infra; and Part 
III, THE RIOT PARTICIPANT, infra. 

28. A final incident was identifiable preceding all 24 surveyed disorders except 
Rockford. See Section II, "The Development of Violence/' infra, for the 
time and place of each final incident and the outbreak of violence. 

29. In our surveys at least 88 prior incidents were identified by Negro inter- 
viewees as having been widely known and remembered at the time of the 
outbreak of violence, as having been a source or exemplification of griev- 
ances, and as having contributed to the disorders. The number of such 
prior precipitating incidents in a given city cannot be stated with certainty. 
Different sources recalled different events or stressed different aspects of a 
single event. However, we have been able to identify multiple incidents in 
most of the cities surveyed. Such incidents were reported in all except two 
cities (Elizabeth and Tucson; both minor). 

At least 10 prior incidents were identified in Houston (serious); seven in 
Bridgeton (minor); six in Atlanta, Milwaukee and Nashville (one major, 
two serious); five in Cincinnati, Newark and Plainfield (all major); four in 
Cambridge and the June and September Dayton disorders (two serious, 
one minor); three in Detroit, Jersey City, New Haven and Phoenix (one 
major, two serious and one minor); two in Englewood, Grand Rapids, Jack- 
son, New Brunswick, Paterson, Rockford and Tampa (one major, three 
serious and three minor). Twenty-eight prior incidents occurred within a 
week preceding violence, nine occurred one month to one week prior, 36 
occurred six months to one month prior, eleven occurred one year to six 
months prior to the violence. One year was used as an arbitrary time limii for 
counting incidents, except when the incident was identified as particularly 
significant to the disorder in that city. Four such incidents were identified: 
In Newark (the 1965 shooting of a Negro by police), in Jersey City (a 
disturbance in 1964), in Englewood (a 1962 disturbance), and in Cambridge 
(racial tensions necessitating the presence of National Guardsmen from 
1963 to 1965). 

30. See the section on "Grievances" in Part IV, infra. 

31. Such actions were identified as prior incidents in 35 cases preceding 18 
disturbances (Atlanta, Bridgeton, Cincinnati, the June and September 
Dayton disturbances, Detroit, Englewood, Houston, Jersey City, Mil- 
waukee, Nashville, New Brunswick, New Haven, Newark, Paterson, 
Plainfield, Rockford and Tampa; six major, six serious and six minor). 
The percentages used for the frequency of the occurrence of type of inci- 
dents total more than 100 percent since a few incidents fell into more than 
one category. 

32. Thirty-two incidents preceding all 18 disorders fit this pattern. Responses 
to a larger group constituted four incidents, all involving groups of demon- 

165 


strators (Cincinnati, Nashville, and twice in Houston; one major and two 
serious). 

33. Bridgeton, Cambridge, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Houston, Jackson, Mil- 
waukee, Nashville, Newark, Phoenix, Tampa and Tucson (four major, 
six serious and two minor). 

34. The two exceptions were Cambridge and Houston (both serious). The in- 
cident in Cambridge occurred when police fired at a group of Negroes leaving 
a protest meeting, and in Houston when they arrested a Negro trying to 
address a group of demonstrators. 

35. This was the case in 15 instances preceding nine disorders (Atlanta, 
Bridgeton, Cambridge, Houston, Milwaukee, Nashville, New Haven, 
Newark and Phoenix; two major, six serious and one minor). 

36. This occurred in five cases preceding four disorders (Cambridge, the June 
Dayton disturbance, Houston and Nashville; all serious). 

37. Atlanta and the June Dayton disturbance (both serious) featured national- 
ly-known militants. Cincinnati, the September Dayton disturbance and 
Plainfield (two major and one minor) involved only local leaders. 

38. Atlanta, Cincinnati and the September Dayton disturbance (one major, 
one serious and one minor). 

39. The June Dayton and Plainfield disturbances (both serious). 

40. This occurred in 15 cases preceding nine disturbances (Atlanta, Bridgeton, 
Cambridge, the June Dayton disorder, Detroit, Jackson, Milwaukee, 
Nashville and Tampa; three major, five serious, one minor). 

41. Atlanta, the June and September Dayton disturbance, Detroit, Englewood, 
Jersey City and Paterson (one major, three serious and three minor). The 
previous disorder counted in Detroit was the "Kercheval incident" in 
August of 1966 mentioned in the text of this section, and not the 1943 
Detroit riot. In Dayton, the June 1967 disorder was counted as a prior 
incident in relation to the September disorder. 

42. Atlanta, Cincinnati, Grand Rapids, Houston, Jersey City, Milwaukee and 
Plainfield (three major, three serious and one minor). 

43. The Newark disorder was specifically identified as a prior incident in 
Bridgeton and Plainfield (one major and one minor). The Detroit riot was 
so identified in Grand Rapids and Phoenix (both serious). 

44. Elizabeth, Englewood, Jersey City, New Brunswick and Paterson (one 
serious, four minor). 

See Part I of this Chapter for a discussion of the patterns of the disorders m 
terms of timing and geographic distribution. The impact of communications 
media on the propagation of disorders is discussed in Chapter 16. 

45. This was the case in nine or more instances preceding six disturbances 
(Bridgeton, Cincinnati, Jackson, Milwaukee, Newark and Plainfield; four 
major, one serious and one minor). The initial refusal to fund or the can- 
cellation of funding by officials responsible for federally-financed anti- 
poverty programs was included in this category. There were three cases 

Preceding three disturbances (the June Dayton disorder, New Haven and 
'hoenix; all serious). 

46. This was the case in eight instances preceding eight disorders (Cambridge, 
Cincinnati, the September Dayton disorder, Detroit, Houston, Milwaukee, 
New Brunswick, and Paterson; three major, three serious and two minor). 

47. This incident was not included in the category of racist activities, since 
the shooting apparently was not motivated entirely by the victim s ethnic 
origin. 

48. Bridgeton, Detroit, Houston, Milwaukee, Nashville, Newark and Tampa 
(four major, two serious and one minor). 

49. Atlanta,, Cincinnati and the September Dayton disturbance (one major 
and two serious). - . 
Meetings to protest actions involved in prior incidents on the part ot city 
officials other than the police were identified as the final incident preceding 
two disorders (the June Dayton disturbance and Plainfield; one major 
and one serious). 

50. This is readily apparent from the charts annexed to this Report, which 
portray graphically the varying levels of violence during the period of eacn 
of the 24 surveyed disorders. 

51. All except Bridgeton, Cambridge, Elizabeth, Jersey City, New Brunswick 
and New Haven (two serious and four minor disturbances). In eight ot tne 
18 cases the estimated size of the groups ranged from 50 to 100 (the Sep- 
tember Dayton disorder, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Houston, Jackson, Fat- 

166 


erson, Phoenix and Plainfield; two major, five serious and one minor); in 
six cases from 100 to 200 (Cincinnati, the June Dayton disorder, Engle- 
wood, Nashville, Rockford and Tucson; one major, two serious and three 
minor); and in six cases from 200 to 1,000 (Atlanta, Houston, Jackson, Mil- 
waukee, Newark and Tampa; three major and three serious). 

52. Detroit, Englewood, Milwaukee, Nashville, New Haven, Paterson, Plain- 
field, Rockford, Tampa and Tucson (four major, three serious and three 
minor). Seven disorders began on Monday (Atlanta, Cambridge, Cincin- 
nati, Elizabeth, Grand Rapids, Jersey City and New Brunswick; one 
major, three serious and three minor). Three began on Tuesday (the Sep- 
tember Dayton disturbance, Houston and Phoenix; two serious and one 
minor), three on Wednesday (the June Dayton disturbance, Jackson and 
Newark; one major and two serious) and one Thursday (Bridgeton; minor). 

53. Eighteen disorders for which temperature information was available oc- 
curred at the end of a day in which the temperature had reached a high of 
at least 79 degrees. In nine cases the temperature had reached 90 degrees or 
more during the day (Atlanta, Cambridge, Cincinnati, the June Dayton 
disturbance, Newark, Paterson, Phoenix, Tampa and Tucson; three major, 
five serious and one minor), in eight cases the temperature had been in the 
80's (Detroit, Elizabeth, Englewood, Grand Rapids, Jersey City, New 
Brunswick, New Haven and Rockford; one major, two serious and five 
minor), and in one city the high temperature was 79 degrees (Milwaukee; 
a major disturbance). 

54. See the annexed charts of levels of violence. 

55. Ibid. Of New Haven's six cycles of violence, one occurred during early 
daylight hours and one began and reached its peak during the afternoon. 
In Plainfield (major) substantial violence began during one afternoon and 
continued, through a midnight peak, into the following day and evening. 
In Grand Rapids (serious) two cycles of violence occurred within one 24- 
hour period, one continuing into daylight hours and the other beginning 
in the afternoon. 

56. In three disorders this was the pattern (Atlanta, Cambridge and Engle- 
wood; two serious and one minor) f In a few cases these cycles were sep- 
arated by one or more 24-hour periods in which little or no violence occurred, 
even during the first days of the disorder. Also see the charts annexed to 
this chapter. 

57. Violence erupted within less than 30 minutes after the occurrence of the 
final incident in 11 disorders (Atlanta, Cincinnati, the June and September 
Dayton disturbances, Grand Rapids, Houston, Jackson, Milwaukee, Plain- 
field, Tampa and Tucson; four major, five serious and two minor). 

In seven other disorders the violence erupted less than two hours after the 
occurrence of a final incident (Bridgeton, Cambridge, Detroit, Nashville, 
New Haven, Newark and Phoenix; two major, four serious and one minor). 
The time span between the final incident and the beginning of violence is 
not easily established for the disturbances in the five New Jersey cities in 
which the final incidents were reports of disorders in neighboring cities 
(Elizabeth, Englewood, New Brunswick, Jersey City and Paterson; one 
serious and four minor). 

58. Violence in 11 disorders reached a peak for the first night, and in some 
cases an overall peak, in less than one hour after the initial outbreak (At- 
lanta, Bridgeton, the June and September Dayton disorders, Englewood, 
Milwaukee, Nashville, New Haven, Newark, Plainfield and Rockford; 
three major, five serious and three minor). In four other disorders violence 
reached a first nightpeak in less than two hours (Jersey City, New Bruns- 
wick, Paterson and Tampa; one major, one serious and two minor), and in 
eight disorders violence reached a first night peak in less than five hours 
(Cambridge, Cincinnati, Elizabeth, Grand Rapids, Houston, Jackson, 
Phoenix and Tucson; one major, five serious and two minor). In one dis- 
turbance (Detroit; major), violence continued to escalate over a period of 
12 to 15 hours after the initial outbreak. 

59. See the annexed charts of levels of violence. 

60. Ibid. All except the June and September Dayton disturbances, Elizabeth, 
Houston and New Brunswick (two serious and three minor). 

61. Bridgeton, Cambridge, Cincinnati, Englewood, Grand Rapids, Jersey 
City, Milwaukee, Nashville, Tampa and Tucson (two major, five serious 
and three minor). 

62. Atlanta, Detroit, Jackson, Newark, New Haven, Paterson, Phoenix, Plain- 
field and Rockford (three major, five serious and one minor). See "Control 
Effort," infra, for a further discussion of violence levels. 

63. Of 34 reported occasions of rock and bottle-throwing, 26 occurred in the 
first two cycles of violence. Of 31 reported occasions of window-breaking, 
24 occurred in the first two cycles. 

64. Of 30 reported occasions of looting, 20 occurred in the first two cycles and 
28 in the first three cycles. 

167 


65. Of 24 reported occasions of fire bombs and Molotov cocktails, 12 occurred 
in the first two cycles and 12 in the second two. 

66. Of 26 reported occasions of fires, 18 occurred in the second and third cycles 
and eight in the first and last. 

67. Of 18 reported occasions, 13 occurred in the second and third cycles. 

68. In only four instances did local police request and receive assistance in the 
initial response from an outside force (Bridgeton, Cambridge, Englewood 
and New Brunswick; one serious and three minor). In the case of Cam- 
bridge, the outside forces consisted of National Guardsmen, State police, 
and the county sheriff and constable. In the other three cases, they con- 
sisted of the police of neighboring towns or county or both. 

69. In ten of the 24 disorders, this was the case (Atlanta, both Dayton disor- 
ders, Elizabeth, Houston, Jersey City, Nashville, Paterson, Phoenix and 
Tucson; six serious and four minor). 

70. In a majority of cases for which we have such information, in 12 out of 22, 
the initial control force was either larger than the crowd on the street or 
no fewer than a ratio of one policeman to every five persons on the street 
(Bridgeton, Cambridge, both Dayton disorders, Elizabeth, Englewood, 
Grand Rapids, Jersey City, New Brunswick, Paterson, Phoenix and Rock- 
ford; five serious and seven minor). 

In one of these instances almost the entire police force of 900 men was 
moved in before a single rioter appeared on the streets (Jersey City; minor). 
In the remaining ten cases the ratio varied; from one policeman to every 
six persons on the street (New Haven; serious), to one policeman to 300 
people on the street (Tampa; major). The median ratio in these ten cases 
was one policeman to 25 persons on the street (Cincinnati, Detroit, Hous- 
ton, Jackson, Nashville, Newark, Plainfield, and Tucson; four major, three 
serious and one minor). 

71. In at least one case, the police rushed at the crowd with nightsticks 
(Newark; major). In only one case was a shot fired by the police during 
the initial response, and in that case it was a single shot (Cambridge; 
serious). 

72. Englewood, Grand Rapids, Jersey City, Milwaukee, New Brunswick, New 
Haven, Newark, Paterson, Rockford and Tucson (two major, three serious 
and five minor). 

In at least five of these cases, arrests were made (Englewood, Jersey City, 
New Brunswick, Paterson, and Tucson; one serious and four minor). 

73. Atlanta, Bridgeton, Cincinnati, Detroit, Elizabeth, Houston, Phoenix and 
Tampa (three major, three serious and two minor). 

74. Detroit, Houston, Phoenix and Tampa; two major and two serious. 

75. Cambridge, both Dayton disturbances, Jackson, Nashville and Plainfield 
(one major, four serious and one minor). 

76. See annexed charts of levels of violence. In at least 13 instances the initial 
control response appeared to fail, in this sense. The three control approaches, 
dispersal, reconnaissance containment, were almost equally represented in 
this group: six of these were cases of dispersal (Englewood, Grand Rapids, 
Milwaukee, New Haven, Newark and Tucson; two major; two serious and 
two minor); four cases of containment (Cambridge, both Dayton disorders 
and Jackson; three serious and one minor); and three were cases of recon- 
naissance (Detroit, Houston and Tampa;  two major and one serious). 

77. If violence continued, or resumed after a pause, the second control response 
by local police (and, in the instances we have noted, by the outside forces 
which by then had arrived) again was one of the three categories of dis- 
persal, reconnaissance and containment. However, at this stage, dispersal 
was used in a slightly larger number of cases than at the stage of the initial 
response: twelve cases, two more than in the initial response (Atlanta, 
Bridgeton, Cambridge, Cincinnati, Detroit, Englewood, Milwaukee, New- 
ark, New Brunswick, New Haven, Paterson and Rockford; four major, four 
serious and four minor). Containment was also now used in a slightly 
larger number of cases than at the earlier stage: nine cases, one more than 
before (both Dayton disturbances, Grand Kapids, Jackson, Nashville, 
Phoenix, Plainfield, Tampa and Tucson; two major, five serious and two 
minor). Reconnaissance, the most passive tactic and therefore under- 
standably less tenable in the face of continued violence, was abandoned by 
half the forces which had used it initially but surprisingly was still employed 
by half: three forces (Cincinnati and Detroit, which turned to dispersal, 
and Tampa, which turned to containment; three major) abandoned 
reconnaissance for one of the other tactics, but reconnaissance was still 
used by three (Cambridge, Elizabeth, and Houston; two serious and one 
minor). 

78. See footnote 22 to the section on "Levels of Violence and Damage" in 
Part I of this chapter. See also the Profiles on Newark and Detroit in 
Chapter 1. 

168 


79. This combination occurred in at least seven cases, two during the initial 
response (Englewood and Plainfield; one major and one minor) and five 
during a subsequent response (Cincinnati, Grand Rapids, Milwaukee, 
Nashville and New Haven; two major and three serious). 

80. Atlanta, Detroit, Englewood, Grand Rapids, Jackson, Milwaukee, Newark, 
New Brunswick, New Haven, Phoenix and Plainfield (four major, five 
serious and two minor). 

81. Cambridge, Nashville, Newark and New Haven (one major and three 
serious). 

82. One major and one serious. 

83. Cincinnati, Detroit, Jackson, New Haven, Newark, Plainfield, Phoenix, 
Rockford and Tampa (five major, three serious and one minor). In four 
of these nine disturbances (Detroit, Jackson, and, arguably, Phoenix and 
Rockford; one major, two serious and one minor) the entry of extra forces 
occurred after the first outbreak of violence. In four cities (Cincinnati 
Newark, Plainfield, and Tampa; all major) extra forces were brought in 
after two outbreaks of violence. In one city (New Haven; serious) extra 
forces were brought in after three outbreaks of violence. See the annexed 
charts of levels of violence, and type and duration of law enforcement 
mobilization. 

84. In all but two of these cities (Plainfield and, arguably, Rockford; one major 
and one minor) violence recurred thereafter on two occasions. In three 
cases, (Cincinnati, Tampa and Phoenix; two major and one serious) the 
subsequent violence was at lower levels than before the extra forces' 
arrival. But in the majority of cases (Detroit, Jackson, New Haven, New- 
ark, Plainfield and Rockford; three major, two serious and one minor) the 
intensity of violence recurring after the arrival of extra forces was equal 
to or greater than that of the earlier violence. 

85. Bridgeton, Cambridge, Englewood and New Brunswick (one serious and 
three minor). 

86. In one city (Englewood; minor) four outbreaks followed; in four cities 
(Bridgeton, Cambridge, Grand Rapids, and Jersey City; two serious and 
two minor) two outbreaks followed; and in one city (New Brunswick; 
minor) a single outbreak followed. 

87. In three of the six cities (Bridgeton, Englewood and Grand Rapids; one 
serious and two minor) the level of violence in one or more successive out- 
breaks was the same as or higher than that in the first outbreak of disorder. 
In three of these cities (Cambridge, Jersey City and New Brunswick; one 
serious and two minor) the later outbreak or outbreaks was of lower 
intensity than  the first or there was no further outbreak  of violence. 

88. Atlanta, both Dayton disorders, Elizabeth, Houston, Nashville, Paterson 
and Tucson; five serious and three minor. 

89. Two of these cities (Paterson and Tucson; one serious and one minor), had 
four outbreaks; one (Atlanta; serious) had three outbreaks; two (Elizabeth 
and Nashville; one serious and one minor), had two outbreaks; and three 
(both Dayton disorders and Houston; two serious and one minor), had one 
outbreak. Of the four cities which had multiple outbreaks, three (Atlanta, 
Paterson and Tucson; two serious and one minor), had subsequent out- 
breaks of violence at the same or a higher level of violence than the first 
outbreak. 

90. There is evidence of a total of at least 68 such meetings in 21 of the 24 
disturbances studied: only in three disorders (Cambridge, Milwaukee and 
Rockford; one major, one serious and one minor) is there no evidence of 
such meetings. The annexed charts include, on a horizontal line near the 
top, a depiction of such meetings through the period of disorder in the 21 


91. In 17 of the 21 disturbances (excepting only Atlanta, Jackson, Jersey City 
and Paterson; three serious and one minor) the first meetings occurred 
either immediately before the disorder erupted or during the first or second 
day of disorders. 

In only three of the 17 cases (Cincinnati, the Dayton September disturbance 
and New Brunswick; one major and two minor) did such meetings occur 
before the outbreak of violence. 

92. Of the 16 disorders which had a duration of more than two days, the 
meetings also continued beyond that point in nine cases (Cincinnati, the 
Dayton June disturbance, Detroit, Englewood, Grand Rapids, New 
Haven, Newark, Plainfield and Tampa; five major, three serious and one 
minor). In five of these nine cases (the Dayton June disturbance, Detroit, 
Englewood, Grand Rapids and Tampa; two major, two serious and one 
minor), the meetings also continued through the final two days of the dis- 
orders. 

93. Of the 21 disturbances in which such meetings occurred, established Negro 
leaders participated in meetings in 18 (all except Englewood, Jackson, and 
Phoenix; two serious and one minor). 

169 


94. Eight out of 21. In three cases (Englewood, Jackson and Phoenix; two 
serious and one minor), youths were the sole Negro participants in meetings 
with government officials. 

95. Cincinnati, Nashville, New Brunswick, Plainfield and Tampa (three major, 
one serious and one minor). Of these five cases, the two elements of the 
Negro Community attended meetings together in two disorders (Cincin- 
nati and Plainfield; one major, one serious) and in the remaining three 
disorders they attended such meetings separately. 

96. This was the case in five disorders (Atlanta, Cincinnati. Houston, Plain- 
field and Phoenix; two major and three serious). In one of the five disorders 
(Phoenix; serious) the only meeting in which established Negro leadership 
participated was one with Negro youths. In the remaining four cases, 
established Negro leadership also met with government officials. In three 
of the five disorders, Negro youths also met with government officials (all 
except Atlanta and Houston; both serious). 

97. This occurred in nine of the 21 disturbances in which such meetings took 
place (Atlanta, Bridgeton, Cincinnati, the Dayton June disturbance, 
Elizabeth, Grand Rapids, Newark, New Brunswick and New Haven; one 
major, five serious and three minor). Also involved were representatives 
of local human relations commissions (Bridgeton, Cincinnati, both Dayton 
disturbances, Elizabeth, Nashville, New Haven, Newark, Plainfield, Tampa 
and Tucson; four major, three serious and four minor); state community 
relations agencies (Jersey City, Newark, Plainfield and Tampa; three major 
and one minor) and federal agencies. In four cities (Cincinnati, Detroit, 
Jersey City and Newark; three major and one minor) officials of the Com- 
munity Relations Service of the U.S. Department of Justice were par- 
ticipants in meetings. 

98. Meetings during 19 of the 21 disorders followed this pattern (all except 
Houston and Tucson; one serious and one minor). In 13 cases the grievance 
related to the handling of the precipitating incident by the police (Bridge- 
ton, Cincinnati, Elizabeth, Grand Rapids, Jackson, Jersey City, Nashville, 
Newark, New Brunswick, New Haven, Paterson, Plainfield and Phoenix; 
three major, six serious and four minor). 

99. Meetings during 12 of the 21 disorders followed this pattern (all except 
Atlanta, Bridgeton, the Dayton September disturbance, Detroit, Elizabeth, 
Nashville, Newark, New Haven and Paterson; two major, four serious and 
three minor). 

In seven cases the pre-existing grievances related to unemployment and 
underemployment (Cincinnati, the Dayton June disturbance, Englewood, 
Jersey City, New Brunswick, Phoenix and Tucson; one major, two serious 
and four minor). In six cases they related to inadequate recreation facilities 
(the Dayton June disturbance, Jersey City, New Brunswick, Plainfield, 
Tampa and Tucson; two major, one serious and three minor). 

100. This was the case in 10 of the 21 disorders in which meetings were held. In 
most of these cases (8 of 10), the earlier meetings or early stages of meetings 
focussed on disorder-related grievances and the later meetings, or stages 
of meetings, focussed on pre-existing grievances (Cincinnati, Englewood, 
Grand Rapids, Houston, Jackson, Jersey City, Phoenix and Tarmoa; two 
major, four serious and two minor). In only two cases (New Brunswick and 
Plainfield; one major and one minor), was the order of subjects reversed. 

101. The only disorders in which counter-rioters were not active were Bridgeton, 
Cambridge, the Dayton September disorder, Englewood, Milwaukee and 
Rockford (one major, one serious and four minor). 

102. For a discussion of this study and the characteristics of those who so iden- 
tified themselves, as compared with rioters, see Part III, THE RIOT 
PARTICIPANT, infra. 

103. Cincinnati, the Dayton June disorder, Detroit, Elizabeth, Grand Rapids, 
Houston, Nashville, Newark, New Brunswick, New Haven, Paterson, 
Plainfield, Phoenix, Tampa and Tucson (five major, seven serious and three 
minor). 

104. For example, in Cincinnati the police opposed official recognition of counter- 
rioters, whereas in Detroit and Dayton there was close cooperation between 
police and counter-rioters. 

106. Nine of 15 (Cincinnati, the Dayton June disorder, Detroit, Elizabeth, 
Grand Rapids, New Brunswick, Newark, Phoenix and Tampa; four major, 
three serious and two minor). 

106. Houston, Nashville, New Haven. Paterson, Plainfield and Tucson (one 
major, four serious and one minor). 

107. In Elizabeth and Newark the counter-rioters wore arm bands (one major 
and one minor). 

108. Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Jackson, Jersey City and Newark (three 
major, two serious and one minor). 

109. Examples are: employees of city agencies (Detroit and Cincinnati; two 
major); ministers (Atlanta, Phoenix and Tampa; one major and two serious); 
college students  (Grand  Rapids,  Newark,  Jackson and Nashville;  one 

170 


major and three serious); civil rights leaders (Atlanta and Cincinnati; one 
major and one serious); young Negro militants (Phoenix, Jersey City and 
New Haven; two serious and one minor); poverty workers (Atlanta, 
Phoenix and Cincinnati; one major and two serious) and admitted former 
riot participants (Tampa; major). 
110. Newark (major). In Paterson (serious) they held a block dance; in Phoenix 
(serious), they promised to make attempts to find jobs for rioters; in Jackson 
(serious) they kept nonstudents out of college dormitories; and in Atlanta 
(serious) , they attempted to organize a Youth Corps Patrol, similar to Day- 
ton's "White Hats." Counter-rioters used physical force to restrain rioters 
in two cities (Tampa and Nashville; one major and one serious). In neither 
case was the use of force officially authorized. 
1. All four sources are subject to limitations, and we have therefore used each 
as a reliability check on the others. Eyewitness accounts are subject to 
retrospective distortion. Data on arrestees also involve built-in biases. The 
fact of arrest alone, without subsequent trial and conviction does not con- 
stitute evidence of the crime charged, and there has not been sufficient 
time for many of the 1967 riot arrestees to be brought to trial. Many of 
the most active rioters may have escaped arrest, while many of the unin- 
volved, or even counter-rioters, may have been arrested in the confusion. 
Finally, questions about riot activity in interview surveys may elicit over- 
statements of participation by some interviewees and under-statements 
by others. 

We are conducting a continuing study of arrest records in a number of 
cities which experienced disorders in 1967 and in some earlier years as well. 
So far we have studied the records of 13,788 persons arrested during dis- 
turbances in 22 cities in 1967. The unpublished study of arrestees in Detroit, 
which was sponsored by the Department of Labor, Manpower Adminis- 
tration, involved interviews with 496 arrestees. 

The Detroit and Newark surveys furnish the most comprehensive infor- 
mation on mass participation. 

The Detroit survey data represent a reanalysis by Dr. Nathan S. Caplan 
and Jeffery M. Paige, Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, 
of data collected during the two weeks following the disorder, in a study 
sponsored by the Detroit Urban League. The Newark study was con- 
ducted for the Commission by Dr. Caplan and Mr. Paige, approximately 
six months after the disorder. 

The Detroit analysis is based on 393 interviews with Negroes aged 15 and 
over. The Newark data are based on 233 interviews with Negro males 
between the ages of 15 and 35. In both surveys, the sampling area was 
determined by identifying the 1960 census tracts in which violence and 
damage occurred. Newspaper accounts were used to identify the location 
of riot damage, fires and looting. In Detroit, the sample was drawn from 
two riot areas, the West Side and the East side, including the following 
census tracts: nine through 22, 26-28, 36-43, 115-123 and 152-188 (West 
Side); 759-778 and 789-793 (East Side). The Newark sample was drawn 
from an inner-city area consisting of census tracts 12, 29-33, 38-40, 58-67 
and 81-82. 

A probability sample was drawn for both cities so that the probability of 
inclusion for any household in Detroit was approximately l/50th and 
Newark l/44th. Blocks were selected at random from within the specified 
census tracts and constituted the primary sampling unit for each study. In 
Detroit, lists of all dwellings in the selected blocks were prepared from a 
city directory. Every fifteenth address was identified and assigned to an 
interviewer. In Newark, segments of approximately 10 dwelling units^were 
constructed by field enumeration of blocks selected at random and assigned 
to interviewers. Both studies used techniques described by Leslie Kish in 
Survey Sampling, New York, Wiley, 1965, Chapter 9. 

Each interviewer in Detroit was instructed to conduct interviews only at 
those dwelling units on his assignment sheet. Within households only 
Negroes were to be interviewed, and the interviewer was instructed to list 
all members of the household and then select every other one for inter- 
viewing. The interviewer was required to return twice if there was no 
answer to the initial call or if the respondent to be interviewed was not at 
home. This procedure yielded 437 interviews for 50 blocks, or 8.7 interviews 
per block. 

In order to enlarge the sample of those who were likely to identify them- 
selves as rioters, interviewers in Newark were told to interview only Negro 
males between the ages 15 and 35. They were instructed to interview all 
eligible respondents in each household. They were also required to return 
three times if there was no answer or if an eligible respondent was not at 
home. A total of 233 interviews were completed in 24 blocks, or 9.7 inter- 
views per block. 

In Detroit, 67.0 percent of all eligible respondents were interviewed; in 
Newark, 66.0 percent. While these response rates do not compare favorably 

171 


y 

with the usual 80-85 percent response rate in white, middle-class samples, 
they are comparable to the rates in other ghetto area studies. A Negro 
response rate of 71.0 percent was reported in another study in approximately 
the same area of Newark. See Chernik, J., Indik, B., and Sternliev, G., 
"Newark-New Jersey: Population and Labor Force/' Spring 1967, Institute 
of Management and Labor Relations, Rutgers — The State University, New 
Brunswick, New Jersey. 

In both surveys, questions were designed to permit comparisons of the 
characteristics and attitudes of those who (a) admitted active participation 
in rioting, referred to as "self-reported rioters;" (b) those who said they had 
sought to stop the rioting, the "counter-rioters;" and (c) those who claimed 
not to have been involved, the "noninvolved." These classifications were 
based on the answers to two questions, one direct and one indirect. The in- 
direct question asked how^ active the respondent had been during the riot, 
without specifying in particular what he had been doing. The second ques- 
tion, which appeared later in the questionnaire, asked whether the re- 
spondent had participated in various activities, such as trying to stop the 
riot, calling the fire department, or picking up goods and taking them home. 
Respondents were classified as "rioters" if they answered either that they 
were "active" or admitted one or more specific anti-social activities. They 
were classified as "counter-rioters" if they said that they were engaged in 
some pro-social activity whether or not they said they were "active." If 
they said that they had stayed home and also claimed not to have been 
"active," they were classified as "noninvolved." In the Detroit survey the 
analysis is based only on the answers of those 393 respondents who were 
willing to answer at least one of these classificatory questions. In the Newark 
survey the entire sample of 233 was used, and those who refused to answer 
either of the classificatory questions were included in the "noninvolved." 

112. In Detroit, 11.2 percent (44) of the 393 respondents identified themselves 
as rioters, 15.8 percent (62) as counter-rioters, and the majority, 73 percent 
(287), as noninvolved. Bystanders included approximately 5 percent who 
admitted to having gone into the riot area but claimed not to have partici- 
pated; and another 15 to 20 percent who claimed to have watched from the 
front steps or sidewalk in front of their homes. For purposes of analysis all 
of the 393 respondents other than the self-reported rioters and counter- 
rioters were treated as the "noninvolved." In the Newark survey, where 
the sample was restricted to Negro males between the ages of 15 and 35, 
45.4 percent identified themselves as rioters, and 54.6 percent as non- 
involved. About 5 percent of the respondents identified themselves as 
counter-rioters, but were included as noninvolved because the number of 
persons was so small. The proportion of respondents who admitted active 
participation does not necessarily indicate tne levels of support for rioting 
among inner-city Negroes. In Detroit, 23.3 percent of those interviewed 
felt that more was to be gained than lost through rioting. In Newark 47.0 
percent agreed that more was to be gained and 77.1 percent said that they 
were generally sympathetic to the rioters. 

113. In the more detailed discussion which follows, only those characteristics of 
the counter-rioter which differed from those of the noninvolved are high- 
lighted. 

114. Of 13,012 arrestees in 22 cities (Atlanta, Bridgeton, Cincinnati, Dayton, 
Detroit, Elizabeth, Englewood, Grand Rapids, Houston, Jackson, Jersey 
City, Milwaukee, Nashville, New Brunswick, New Haven, Newark, Pater- 
son, Phoenix, Plainfield, Rockford, Tampa and Tucson; six major, nine 
serious and seven minor) 10,792 (82.9 percent) were Negroes, 1967 (15.1 
percent) were whites, 78 (.6 percent) were Puerto Ricans and 37 (.3 per- 
cent) were of other races. The ethnic origin of 138 arrestees (1.1 percent) 
was unknown. 

A study of 348 arrestees in Grand Rapids (serious) divided the disorder in 
that city into two time segments of 4 hours and 36 hours. During the first 
4 hours of the disorder, 95 percent were Negroes. The proportion of Negro 
arrestees declined to 66 percent during the remaining 48 hours of the dis- 
order. See "Anatomy of a Riot," United Community Services, Research 
Department, Grand Rapids and Kent County, Michigan, 1967.

120. Of 266 arrestees in five cities (Atlanta, New Brunswick, Plainfield, Tampa 
and Tucson; two major, one serious and two minor), 106 (40 percent) were 
born in the state in which the disorder occurred, 98 (37 percent) were born 
m the South (but not in the state in which the disorder occurred in the 
cases of Atlanta and Tampa; one major and one serious) and 23 (8 percent) 
were born elsewhere. The state of birth of 39 persons (15 percent) was 
undetermined. For purposes of the sample, the South was defined as Ala- 
bama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mary- 
land, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee 
Texas, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia. 
The discrepancy between the percentages of the non-involved brought up 
in the North in Newark and Detroit (two major) is not significant since 
the Detroit sample includes more older people than the Newark sample 
This difference does not affect the validity of the figures for youthful rioters

146. Our discussion relies heavily upon 1960 census data, which are always the 
most complete and usually the most recent data available. Nevertheless, 
1960 statistics are outdated for describing American urban life in 1967 and 
consequently, we used more recent data wherever possible. 

We have examined, for most purposes in this section, 20 of the 23 surveyed 
riot cities. Three cities (Houston, Jackson and Nashville; three serious) 
wexe excluded because their disturbances were more directly campus- 
related than city-related. 

In each of 17 cities, we have compared conditions in the riot area with con- 
ditions elsewhere in (1) the city as a whole, and (2) the metropolitan area 
of which the city is a part, including the suburban areas. In addition, we 
have sought to determine whether racial differences affect these compari- 
sons. To do this we have identified census tract* in which violence and 
damage occurred. This study of census tracts is limited to 17 cities because 
identification of the disturbance area for purposes of analysis was not pos- 
sible for three cities (Bridgeton, Cambridge and New Brunswick; one serious 
and two minor). They are not divided into census tracts. 
We recognize that participants in the disorders did not necessarily live in 
the area of disorder. However, we have attempted to learn whether the 
disturbance areas have characteristics which set them apart from the cities 
and metropolitan areas in which the disturbance areas are situated. 
The disturbance areas were primarily commercial areas in a part of the city 
having a high concentration of Negro residents. These were usually char- 
acterized by a number of retail or wholesale shops, often with residences 
above the shops and with residential areas immediately adjacent to the 
commercial streets. In two cities (Atlanta and Tucson; one serious and one 
minor) the disturbance area was primarily residential. 

147. After studying 100 cities, the Department of Labor reached the same con- 
clusion: "Negroes living in non-poverty areas were not much better off than 
those in poverty arsas; among whites, the difference* were very sharp." (U.S. 
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Special Labor Force 
Report No. 75, "Poverty Areas of Our Major Cities," October, 1966, 
p. 1105.) 

148. The Bureau of the Census categorizes citizens as white and nonwhite. 
Since 92 percent of the nonwhites in the United States are Negroes, we have 
used the terms "Negro" and "nonwhites" interchangeably throughout this 
section. The numbers compared in the section are medians for the 17 cities. 

149. In eight cities, white population also increased in that period however, 
it did so at a much lower rate. Only Englewood (minor) showed no change 
in white population during that period. 

150. In 13 of 17 cities (Atlanta, Cincinnati, Dayton, Detroit, Grand Rapids, 
Jersey City, Milwaukee Newark, Paterson, Phoenix, Tucson, Rockford 
and Tampa; five major, five serious and three minor), including seven of the 
cities which experienced the most severe violence, the percentage of Negro 
population in the disturbance area was more than twice the percentage of 
Negro population in the entire city; in nine of the cities, the percentage of 
Negro population in the disturbance area was more than triple the city- 
wide percentage. 

151. Comparing Negroes and whites in the cities: The percentage of Ne£ro 
population 24 years of age or younger in all 17 cities exceeded the percent- 
age of whites in that age group. The percentage of Negro population 65 
years of age or older in all 17 cities except two (Phoenix and Tucson; one 
serious and one minor) was less than one-half the percentage of whites in 
that age group. 

Comparing Negroes in the disturbance areas and Negroes in the cities: The 
percentage of Negro population 24 years of age or younger living in the 
disturbance area in approximately half the cities (Cincinnati, Elizabeth, 
Englewood, Grand Rapids, Newark, Phoenix, Plainfield and Tucson; 
three major, two serious and three minor) exceeded the city- wide percent- 
age. The percentages were equal only in Tampa (major). 
The differences we have seen are even greater when the age distribution 
among Negroes in the disturbance areas is compared with the age distribu- 
tion among whites in the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA'S).

152. Comparing Negroes and whites in the cities: The number of median years of

179 


in all 17 cities. In 13 of 17 cities (Atlanta, Cincinnati. Dayton, Detroit, 

Elizabeth..  Englewood,  Grand  Rapids,  Milwaukee,  Phoenix,  Plainfield, 

Rockford, Tampa and Tucson; four major, five serious and four minor) 

there was a difference of at least one year. 

The percentage of Negro population over 25 years of age having eight years 

or less of education in all 17 cities was greater than the percentage of white 

population. 

Comparing Negroes in the disturbance areas and Negroes in the cities: The 
median years of school completed by Negroes in the disturbance area in 
more than half of the 17 cities (Dayton, Elizabeth, Englewood, Grand 
Rapids, Newark, Phoenix, Plainfield, Rockford and Tucson; two major, 
three serious and four minor) was lower than the median rate of education 
for Negroes in the entire city. In three of the 17 cities (Jersey City, Mil- 
waukee and Tampa; two major and one minor) the median years completed 
by Negroes in the disturbance area and by Negroes in the city were equal. 
In the remaining five cities the median rate was slightly higher (less than a 
year's difference) for Negroes in the disturbance area. The difference 
between the median number of years completed was one-tenth of a year for 
the 17 cities. The percentage of Negro population in the disturbance area 
over 25 years of age having eight years or less education was slightly greater 
than the city- wide percentage in 11 of the 17 cities (Dayton, Elizabeth, 
Englewood, Grand Rapids, Milwaukee, Newark, Phoenix, Plainfield, 
Rockford, Tampa and Tucson; four major, three serious and four minor). 
The differences we have seen are even greater when comparing the level of 
education of Negroes in the disturbance areas with that of whites in the

153. Comparing Negroes and whites in the cities: The percentage of Negro 
males in the labor force in nine of 17 cities (Elizabeth, Englewood, Jersey 
City, Milwaukee, New Haven, Newark, Paterson, Rockford and Tampa; 
three major, two serious and four minor) exceeded the percentage of white 
males. The proportion of Negro and white males employed or seeking 
employment was equal in Grand Rapids (serious). 

The percentage of Negro females exceeded the percentage of white females 

in the labor force in all 17 cities. 

Comparing Negroes in the disturbance area and Negroes in the cities: The 

percentage of Negro males in the disturbance area in the labor force, in all 

except seven cities (Dayton, Elizabeth, Englewood, Grand Rapids, Newark, 

Plainfield and Tucson; two major, two serious and three minor), exceeded 

the percentage of Negro males in the entire city in the labor force. 

The percentage of Negro females in the labor force in the disturbance area, 

in all except ten cities (Atlanta, Dayton, Detroit, Elizabeth, Englewood, 

Grand Rapids, Jersey City, Paterson, Phoenix and Plainfield; two major, 

five serious and three minor) was larger than the percentage of Negro 

females in the entire city in the labor force. 

The differences in the percentages of Negroes and whites in the labor force 

again can be seen to be small by comparing Negroes in the disturbance 

area with whites in the SMSA:

Female 38.0 46.6 38.0 46.7 35.2 45.0 

154. Comparing Negroes and whites in the cities: The percentage of Negro 
male unemployment in all 20 cities was higher than the unemployment 
rate for white males. In 13 of the 20 cities (Bridgeton, Cambridge, Cincin- 
nati, Detroit, Englewood, Grand Rapids, Milwaukee, New Brunswick, 
New Haven, Paterson, Phoenix, Plainfield and Rockford; four major, five 
serious and four minor) the rate of unemployment for Negroes was more 
than twice the rate for whites. 

180 


The unemployment rate for Negro females was more than the rate for 

white females in all of the 20 cities except Plainfield (major). 

Comparing Negroes in the disturbance areas and Negroes in the cities: The 

unemployment rate for Negro males in the disturbance area was slightly 

more than the Negro city wide rate in 11 of 17 cities and slightly less in the 

remaining six (Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Englewood, New Haven and 

Paterson; two major, three serious and one minor). 

The disturbance area unemployment rate for Negro females equalled or 

exceeded the citywide rate in seven of 17 cities (Cincinnati, Milwaukee, 

New Haven, Newark,  Rockford,  Tampa and Tucson;, four major,  two 

serious and one minor). 

The differences are even greater  when  the unemployment rate among 

Negroes in the disturbance areas is compared with the unemployment rate 

among whites in the SMSA's:

Female 5.8 9.9 5.1 9.4 4.8 9.5 

More recent and complete data indicate that unemployment and under- 
employment of Negroes are even more serious than the 1960 census revealed. 
The Bureau of the Census estimates that one out of every six Negro males 
between ages 20 and 39 was not counted in the 1960 census. Unemployment 
is likely to be common among the uncounted men. 

The Department of Labor, in November 1966, surveyed 10 slum areas in 
eight cities and obtained slightly earlier unemployment data for slums in 
four other cities. ("A Sharper Look at Unemployment in U.S. Cities and 
Slums," a summary report submitted to the President by the Secretary of 
Labor.) Two of these cities, Detroit and Phoenix (one major and one 
serious) were among the cities we surveyed. 
The Department found, in the slum areas surveyed, that: 

The unemployment rate was approximately three times the nationwide 
rate of 3.7 percent; 

Six and nine-tenths percent of those listed as employed were working 
only part time although they were trying to find full-time work; the com- 
parable figure for the nation as a whole was 2.3 percent; 
Twenty-one percent of those working full time were earning less than $60 
a week; the comparable figure for the nation as a whole was 15.4 percent; 
One-third of the labor force was subemployed. 
The Department of Labor included in its definition of subemployment (i) 
those unemployed in the sense that they are actively looking for work and 
unable to find it; (ii) those working only part time when they are trying to 
get full-time work; (iii) those heads of households under 65 who earn less 
than $60 per week working full time and those individuals under 65 who are 
not heads of households and earn less than $56 per week in a full-time job; 
(iv) half the number of "nonparticipants" (not in the labor force) in the 
male 20-64 age group; and  (v) a conservative and carefully considered 
estimate of the male undercount group.

156. Comparing Negroes and whites in the cities: The percentage of Negro male 
unskilled and service workers in ten of 17 cities (Atlanta, Cincinnati, 
Dayton, Englewood, Grand Rapids, Phoenix, Plainfield, Rockford, Tampa 
and Tucson; three major, four serious and three minor) was at least three 
times the rate of white men. 

The percentage of Negro female unskilled and service workers in all but 
three of 17 cities (Englewood, Jersey City, and Milwaukee; one major 
and two minor) was at least three times the percentage of white females. 
Comparing Negroes in the disturbance areas and Negroes in the cities: The 
percentage of Negro male unskilled and service workers in the disturbance 
areas in 11 of the 17 cities (Dayton, Englewood, Grand Rapids, Jersey City, 

181 


Newark, Paterson, Phoenix, Tucson, Plainfield, Rockford and Tampa; 
three major, four serious and four minor) slightly exceeded the percentage 
in the cities as a whole. The difference between the median of percentages 
in the disturbance areas and the median of percentages in the cities was 
4.5 percent. 

The percentage of Negro female unskilled and service workers in the dis- 
turbance areas in eight of the 17 cities (Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, New 
Haven, Plainfield, Rockford, Tampa and Tucson; four major, two serious 
and two minor) was slightly smaller than the percentage of Negro female 
unskilled and service workers in the cities. The difference in 17 city medians 
was 3.6 percent. 

The differences are even greater when comparing the percentage of Negro 
unskilled and service workers in the disturbance areas with whites in the

157. Comparing Negroes and whites in the cities in 1960: The median income of 
Negroes in 17 cities was 69.5 percent of the median income of whites. The 
1966 nationwide median income earned by Negroes was 58 percent of the 
median income earned by whites. ("Social and Economic Conditions of 
Negroes in the United States," Joint Report by the Bureau of Labor Statis- 
tics and the Bureau of the Census, October, 1967, p. 15. 
The percentage of Negro families in poverty (having an annual income 
under $3,000) in 14 of the 17 cities was twice the percentage of white fam- 
ilies in poverty. In the other three cities (Englewood, Newark and Paterson; 
one major, one serious and one minor) the percentage was at least one and 
one half the percentage of white families. 

Comparing Negroes in the disturbance areas and Negroes in the cities: The 
percentage of the families below the poverty line was slightly higher in the 
disturbance areas in almost two-thirds of 17 cities (Dayton, Elizabeth, 
Englewood, Grand Rapids, Milwaukee, New Haven, Newark, Phoenix, 
Plainfield, Tampa and Tucson; four major, four serious and three minor). 
The differences are even greater when the income levels of Negroes in the 
disturbance areas are compared with the income levels of whites in the

children under 18 living with both parents in all 17 cities was less than the 
percentage of white children that age similarly situated. 
Comparing Negroes in the disturbance areas and Negroes in the cities: The 
percentage of Negro children under 18 living with both parents in the dis- 
turbance area was greater than the city- wide percentage in seven of the 71 
cities (Atlanta, Dayton, Milwaukee, New Haven, Newark, Rockford and 
Tucson; two major, three serious and two minor). 

The differences are even greater when comparing the family status of

160. Comparing Negroes and whites in the cities: The percentage of Negro 
owner-occupied units in all 17 cities was lower than that of whites. In ten 
of the cities (Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Elizabeth, Jersey City, Milwau- 
kee, New Haven, Newark, Paterson and Tampa; five major, three serious 
and two minor) the proportion of white home ownership was at least one 
and one-half that of Negroes. In five of the ten cities (Cincinnati, Milwau- 
kee, New Haven, Newark and Paterson; three major and two serious) the 
percentage of white home ownership was twice that of Negroes. 
Although Negroes paid the same or slightly lower rents than did whites 
among non-home owners in 15 of the 17 cities (all except New Haven and 
Paterson; two serious), they paid a higher proportion of income for rent 
than whites. Median rent as a proportion of median income in 11 of 13 
cities (Atlanta, Cincinnati, Dayton, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Jersey City, 
Milwaukee, Newark, Paterson, Plainfield and Tampa; six major, four 
serious and one minor) was higher for Negroes than for whites. Negroes 
paid the same proportion as whites in Phoenix (serious) and a smaller 
proportion than whites in Englewood (minor). 

The percentage of overcrowded Negro-occupied homes (homes with more 
than 1.01 persons per room) in all of the 17 cities except Tucson (minor) was 
twice the percentage of overcrowded white-occupied homes. In nine of those 
cities (Elizabeth, Englewood, Grand Rapids, Milwaukee, New Haven, 
Paterson, Plainfield, Rockford and Tampa; three major, three serious and 
three minor) the percentage of overcrowded Negro-occupied homes was 
three times the percentage of white homes. 

The percentage of homes occupied by whites which were sound and had 
adequate plumbing facilities was one and one-half times the proportion of 
Negro-occupied homes which met those criteria, in ten of 17 cities (Atlanta, 
Cincinnati, Elizabeth, Jersey City, Milwaukee, New Haven, Newark, 
Paterson, Phoenix and Tucson; three major, four serious and three minor). 
Comparing Negro housing in the disturbance area and in the entire city: 
The percentage of Negro owner-occupied units in the disturbance area 
exceeded the Negro city- wide percentage in only six of 17 cities (Atlanta, Cin- 
cinnati, Jersey City, New Haven, Paterson and Tucson; one major, three 
serious and two minor). The city- wide median for 17 cities was 3.8 percent- 
age points higher than the median for the disturbance area. 
Negroes in the disturbance area paid more for rent than Negroes paid city- 
wide in eight of 13 cities (Atlanta, Cincinnati, Dayton, Detroit, Grand 
Rapids, Jersey City, Paterson and Plainfield; three major, four serious and 
one minor). In Milwaukee (major) they paid the same. In four cities they 
paid less (Englewood, Newark, Phoenix and Tampa; two major, one serious 
and one minor). 

The proportion of income paid for rent by Negroes living in the disturbance 
area slightly exceeded the city-wide proportion paid by Negroes in eight of 
x? Cltles (Cmcinnati, Dayton, Englewood, Grand Rapids, Milwaukee, 
Newark, Plainfield and Tampa; four major, one serious and three minor). 
The proportions were equal in Detroit (major). The difference in medians 
was three-tenths of one percent. 

The percentage of overcrowded homes in which Negroes lived in the dis- 
turbance area was slightly greater than the percentage of overcrowded 
homes m which Negroes lived city-wide in eight of the 17 cities (Cincinnati, 
Jkiizabeth Englewood, Grand Rapids, Plainfield, Newark, Tampa and 
lucson; four major, one serious and three minor). The median 17-city 
difference was 1.1 percentage points. 

The percentage of sound homes in the entire city was slightly greater than 
m the disturbance area in 10 of 17 cities (Dayton, Englewood, Grand 
Rapids, Milwaukee, New Haven, Newark, Plainfield, Rockford, Tampa 
and lucson; four major, three serious and three minor). The difference in 
medians was .7 percentage point. The differences are even greater when 
comparing the housing conditions of Negroes in the disturbance areas and 
of whites m the SMSA's:

communities. 

162. Source: The Municipal Year Book 1967, The International City Managers' 
Association (Chicago 1967). 

163. Detroit, Elizabeth, Jersey City, Newark, New Haven, Paterson, Rockford 
and Tampa (three major, two serious and three minor). In the case of 
Paterson, virtually no powers were left to the aldermen. 

164. Atlanta, Bridgeton, Cambridge, Englewood and Plainfield (one major, two 
serious and two minor). 

165. In the five cities having a council-city manager system, the city manager 
was appointed by the council, and the mayor's powers were limited (Cin- 
cinnati, Dayton, Grand Rapids, Phoenix and Tucson; one major, three 
serious and one minor). 

In the one city having a commission form of government (New Brunswick; 
minor), the mayor was selected by the commission from its own member- 
ship and traditionally was the commissioner who received the largest pop- 
ular vote* The mayor shared executive power with the other commissioners. 

166. In three they were elected by the legislative bodies from their own mem- 
bership (Cincinnati, Dayton and New Brunswick; one major, one serious; 
and one minor). 

167. Bridgeton, Cambridge, Dayton, Englewood, Grand Rapids, New Bruns- 
wick, Plainfield and Tucson (one major, three serious and four minor). The 
part-time mayors had a variety of other occupations: in Bridgeton, the 
mayor was a clothing store clerk; in Cambridge, a plumbing contractor; in 
Dayton, a real estate investor; in Englewood, a businessman who worked 
in New York; in Grand Rapids, a part-owner of a restaurant supply busi- 
ness; in New Brunswick, a housewife; in Plainfield, a lawyer; and in Tucson, 
a pharmacist. 

168. In 15 of the 20 cities, the principal executive, either the mayor or the city 
manager, earned an annual salary ranging from $15,000 to $35,000 (At- 
lanta, Cincinnati, Dayton, Detroit, Elizabeth, Grand Rapids, Jersey City, 
Milwaukee, Newark, New Haven, Paterson, Phoenix, Rockford, Tampa 
and Tucson; five major, six serious and four minor). The other five cities 
studied had no city manager and a part-time mayor whose annual salary 
was less than $2,000 in four cases and $5,500 in one case (Bridgeton, Cam- 
bridge, Englewood, New Brunswick and Plainfield; one major, one serious 
and three minor). In all five cities having a council-city manager system, 
the appointed city manager's salary was significantly higher than the salary 
of the elected mayor (Cincinnati, Dayton, Grand Rapids, Phoenix and 
Tucson; one major, three serious and one minor). 

184 


169. Thirteen mayors had terms of four years (Atlanta, Cambridge, Dayton, 
Detroit, Elizabeth, Grand Rapids, Jersey City, Milwaukee, Newark, New 
Brunswick, Rockford, Tampa and Tucson; four major, four serious and five 
minor). Two had terms of three years (Bridge ton and Paterson; one serious 
and one minor), and five had terms of two years (Cincinnati, Englewood, 
New Haven, Phoenix and Pla infield; two major, two serious and one minor). 
There appeared to be no pattern as to the length of time a mayor had been 
in office prior to the disturbance. 

In four of the 20 cities the mayor had been in office for less than two years 
(Grand Rapids, New Brunswick, Paterson and Tampa; one major, two 
serious and one minor). In three cities the mayor had been in office for 
seven years or more (Milwaukee, New Haven and Rockford; one maior. 
one serious and one minor). In the remaining cities, the mayor's tenure had 
ranged from two to seven years. 

In two cities (Paterson and New Brunswick; one serious and one minor), 
the mayors had been in office for six months and two months respectively. 
In both cases the mayor appealed to people in the disturbance area to give 
the new administration a chance to solve the city's problems, and these 
appeals appeared to have had an effect in dampening the disorders. 

170. Atlanta, Bridgeton, Cincinnati, Dayton, Detroit, New Brunswick, Phoenix 
and Tampa (three major, three serious and two minor). 

171. Cambridge, Grand Rapids, Milwaukee, New Haven, Paterson, Rockford 
and Tucson (one major, four serious and two minor) . 

172. Elizabeth, Englewood, Jersey City, Newark and Plainfield (two major and 
three minor). 

173. Of a total of 207 legislators in the 20 cities, 20 (or 10 percent) were Negroes. 

174. Bridgeton, Elizabeth, Grand Rapids, Rockford, Tampa and Tucson (one 
major, one serious and four minor). 

175. In Newark the budget director and the director of health and welfare were 
Negroes; in Cincinnati, the city solicitor was a Negro; in Jersey City, the 
director of health and welfare was a Negro; and in Detroit, an aide to the 
mayor was a Negro. 

176. Atlanta, Cincinnati, Dayton, Detroit, Englewood, Newark and Phoenix 
(three major, three serious and one minor). 

177. All except Milwaukee, Tampa and Tucson (two major and one minor). 
Of the 205 board of education members in those cities, 24 (or 11 percent) 
were Negro. 

178. Excepting Englewood, New Brunswick and Paterson (one serious and two 
minor). In some instances it was called a "community relations commission" 
or "human rights commission." 

179. Only the Equal Opportunities Commission in New Haven (serious) had 
the power to subpoena witnesses and enforce compliance with its decisions. 

180. Thirteen councils had full-time, paid staff of two or more, responsible to 
the council itself (Atlanta, Cincinnati, Dayton, Detroit, Elizabeth, Grand 
Rapids, Milwaukee, Newark, New Haven, Phoenix, Plainfield, Tampa and 
Tucson; six major, five serious and two minor). In four cities, the councils 
had no paid staff (Bridgeton, Cambridge, Jersey City and Rockford; one 
serious and three minor). 

Three of the four councils having no paid staff had been relatively inactive 
in the year prior to the 1967 summer disturbances. Cambridge (serious) 
held no meetings, and Jersey City (minor) had held one at which they 
decided their services were not needed during the summer. The council in 
Rockford (minor), which had not met for over a year, was in the process 
of being reorganized. 

181. Of the 13 councils from which such information was available, five councils 
reported receiving more than 100 complaints annually (Atlanta, serious, 
700 to 800; Detroit, major, 116; Elizabeth, minor, approximately 200; 
Newark, major, approximately 750; Plainfield, major, approximately 200). 
Three councils reported receiving 50 to 100 complaints (Cincinnati, major, 
approximately 50; New Haven, serious, approximately 60; Phoenix, 
serious, approximately 75). Five councils reported receiving less than 50 
(Dayton, serious, 45; Grand Rapids, serious, approximately 25; Mil- 
waukee, major, approximately 40; Tampa, major, 46; and Tucson, minor, 
10). 

The majority of the complaints from the 12 councils which reported this 
type of information were in the areas of housing discrimination, building 
and housing code enforcement, and discrimination in employment and 
promotion practices. 

182. Two years ago in Rockford the 18-member human relations commission 
was asked to investigate an alleged incident of police brutality but, after a 
preliminary meeting to discuss the matter, held no further meetings. In the 
late spring of 1967, the Commission was reorganized with a number of new 
members. 

185 


In Plainfield, city agencies opposed an attempt by the Human Relations 
Commission to conduct its own investigation of complaints of police 
brutality prior to the 1967 disorder. 

183. Cincinnati, Detroit, Elizabeth, Englewood, Newark, New Haven, Paterson, 
Phoenix and Tucson (three major, three serious and three minor). Only 
those in Detroit, New Haven and Tucson had been in existence more than 
two years prior to the disorder. 

Four police departments (Paterson, Detroit, Rockford and New Haven; 
one major, two serious and one minor) had specialized complaint bureaus 
within the department, and in two cities (Paterson and Detroit) these 
bureaus had investigative authority. 

In Milwaukee there was a Police and Fire Commission consisting of five 
members. Until recently only property owners were authorized by law to file 
complaints with the Commission. The law has since been amended to 
permit any registered voter to file complaints, but few complaints have 
been filed. 

184. Eight of the nine, Englewood (minor) excepted. 

185. Detroit and Newark (both major). 

186. We have not attempted to analyze the often substantial social and economic 
programs of other levels of government. 

Of necessity we have also restricted ourselves to only the most general 
quantitative comparisons, within each of the three cities, of the size of the 
selected federal programs, the number of people in need of them, and 
the number of people in any way reached by them. We have not attempted 
the far more difficult task of evaluating the efficiency of the programs or the 
quality of assistance provided to recipients or its impact on their lives. 
Qualitative evaluation is the responsibility of many other agencies of the 
Federal government and beyond our own mandate. Our evaluation neces- 
sarily assumes that all those reached are reached effectively. If the factor 
of effectiveness were taken into account, the magnitude of the still unmet 
needs might be even greater than our estimates. 

As in "The Pattern of Disadvantage," supra, we have used 1960 Census 
data as the basis for most of our observations as to need. We are keenly 
aware of difficulties involved in comparing 1967 programs with 1960 
needs and have used more recent data wherever available. In most in- 
stances the needs were even greater in 1967 than in 1960. 
Various federal programs account for their expenditures in different ways 
and for different periods of time. We have generally used figures for fiscal 
year 1967, ending June 30, 1967, or calendar year 1967, as available in each 
case. We are cognizant also of the difficulties involved in considering only 
expenditures for 1967 as a measure of Federal efforts to deal with ghetto 

groblems. Much was done in earlier years by these programs and more is 
eing done now. We have generally chosen a single year's funding only as a 
measure of the level of Federal effort during the most recent period. 
The choice of a recent year for measuring Federal expenditures created a 
further problem, however. The amount of funds authorized or obligated for a 
particular program is usually higher than the actual disbursements for 
that program in a given time period, but data on disbursements is usually 
available only some time after the period has ended. With the exception of 
housing and welfare, we have relied upon the higher obligation figures. 

187. Institutional training programs administered through local school boards 
under the Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) have been 
included instead with education programs. 

188. Two of the programs had no fixed number of trainee positions. The follow- 
ing table further describes these programs.

189. Need — In the spring of 1967 the labor force in Newark numbered 155,770 
persons, of whom 90,358 were nonwhite. The unemployment rate during 
that period was 5.9 percent for whites, 11.5 percent for Negroes, and 13.4 
percent for others (principally Spanish-speaking persons). A Rutgers 
University study in the spring of 1967 identified 3,859 unemployed whites, 
8,932 unemployed Negroes, and 1,700 other unemployed nonwhites. 
Programs — During the first two quarters of 1967, 12 job training programs 
in Newark were supported by $2,681,853 of Federal funds. These programs 
provided for 2,840 trainees.

190. Need — The Connecticut State Employment Service estimates there were 
approximately 145,000 to 150,000 nonagrarian workers in the labor force 
in New Haven and 12 surrounding towns during the first three quarters 
of 1967. The unemployment rate for the same period averaged approxi- 
mately 3.5 percent. 

Programs— -During the first three quarters of 1967 there were 14 manpower 
programs in New Haven in various stages of operation. These provided 
$2,150,828 of Federal funds for 1,574 trainees. The number of trainees 
was not available for one program.

••Information not available; 
191. Need — There are more than 295,000 students in the Detroit public schools, 
of whom 43 percent are white and 56 percent Negro. Nearly 60 percent 
(about 175,000) are educationally disadvantaged within the definition of 
Title I. Thirty percent of the white students and 64.5 percent of the 
Negro students are in this group. There are approximately 180,000 func- 
tionally illiterate adults in Detroit. 

The Detroit school board recently stated that it may cost twice as much 
to educate a ghetto child as it costs to educate a suburban child and produce 
the same educational result. The Superintendent of Detroit schools has 
estimated that, to educate inner-city children, as much as $500 or $600 
per pupil is needed in addition to the present average state and local 
expenditure of $565 per pupil. 

Programs — Detroit schools are scheduled to receive about $11 million 
during the 1967-68 school year under ESEA Title I. Of the estimated 175,000 
low-income students, only about 55,000 are direct beneficiaries of Title I 
programs. Thus, while the $11 million represents $200 per student for the 
55,000 direct recipients, 120,000 (or 69 percent) other educationally disad- 
vantaged students are not participating in the programs. 
The Adult Basic Education program is scheduled to receive $244,766 during 
the 1967-68 school year to serve about 3,900 adults. 

Federal funding for public school students from kindergarten through 
high school for the 1967-68 school year will total $14,514,447. For a student 
population of 295,000. these funds add an average of about $49 per student 
to the state and local expenditures of approximately $565 per student.

192. Need — There are approximately 75,000 students in the Newark schools of 
whom 21 percent are whites and 79 percent are Negroes, Puerto Ricans 
and others. Approximately 33,000 (44 percent) of these students are from 
low-income families. In 1960 there were approximately 55,000 functionally 
illiterate adults in Newark. 

Programs — Newark schools are scheduled to receive about $4 million 
during the 1967-68 school year under ESEA Title I. Of the estimated 33,000 
educationally disadvantaged students, only about 24,000 (or 72 percent) are 
direct beneficiaries of the Title I programs. Thus, while $166 per student is 
spent for programs for the direct recipients, 9,000 educationally disad- 
vantaged students are not receiving the benefits of the programs. 
The Adult Basic Education program is scheduled to receive $169,000 
during the 1967-68 school year to serve approximately 3,000 students 
at a cost of about $56 per person. 

Federal funding for public school students from kindergarten through 
high school in Newark during the 1967-68 school year will total $4,554,098. 
For a student population of 75,000, these funds add an average of approxi-

L93. Need — There are more than 21,000 students in the New Haven public 
schools, of whom 47.9 percent are whites and 52.1 percent are Negroesr 
Puerto Ricans and others. In the middle and senior high schools an estimated 
2,500 students are educationally disadvantaged. Of 33 elementary schools, 
14 are designated as inner city or target schools for funds under ESEA Title I, 
and seven others reportedly could have been so designated. More than 50 
percent of all elementary students (6,637 of 13,050) are in the 14 target 
schools. Twenty-two percent of the white students and more than 73 
percent of the nonwhite students are in the target schools. There are an 
estimated 20,000 functionally illiterate adults in New Haven. 
Programs — New Haven schools are scheduled to receive nearly $1 million 
in the 1967-68 school year under ESEA Title I. Of the 2,500 low-income 
students in middle and senior high schools, approximately 1,000 are bene- 
ficiaries of the programs. Because of the comprehensive nature of the 
Title I programs in New Haven, all 6,637 students in the 14 target elemen- 
tary schools are recipients of the programs although not all are educa- 
tionally disadvantaged. Thejiumber of educationally disadvantaged students 
who do not receive benefits from the programs because they attend the 
19 non-target elementary schools is unknown. 

The Adult Basic Education program is scheduled to receive $23,000 during 
the 1967-68 school year to serve almost 700 persons. 

Federal funding for public school students from kindergarten through 
high school for the 1967-68 school year will total $1,090,260. For a student 
population of 21,000, these funds add an average of nearly $52 per student 
to the locai and state expenditures of approximately $697 per student.

194. We have considered as substandard, in accordance with the definition of 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, all units which were 
characterized by the census as dilapidated or as lacking one or more 
plumbing facilities. U. S. Bureau of Census, Measuring the Quality of 
Housing, An Appraisal of Census Statistics and Methods, Working Paper 
#25. Washington, D. C, 1967. We have treated as overcrowded all units 
identified by the census as having more than 1.01 persons per room, in 
accordance with the definition recently used by the Census Bureau and 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Social and Economic Conditions of Negroes 
in the United States, October, 1967, p. 57. Since many units are included in 
both categories, it is not possible to establish a total level of need by adding 
the numbers of units in the two categories, and we have therefore applied 
the two standards separately. 

195. Need — In 1960 there were 553,198 housing units in Detroit. Of these, 
36,810 were substandard and 45,126 were overcrowded. 

Programs — Federal funds in the amount of $78,656,000 were expended 
through September,  1967  for housing completed  under the first three 

Erograms examined. An additional $41,000 were expended through Decem- 
er, 1967 under the Rent Supplements program. BMIR mortgages in the 
amount of $4,173,000 were insured by FHA through September, 1967. In 
the 1957-67 period, although no new public housing was constructed, 25 
housing units were added as a result of FHA foreclosures. During this 
period, 346 units were constructed for the elderly and handicapped; 
families in 62 units were assisted through rent supplements; and mortgages 
on 325 units were insured under the BMIR program.

206. Using this material we sought to identify and assign weights to the four 
types of grievances which appeared to have the greatest significance to the 
Negro community in each city. We made judgments with regard to the 
severity of particular grievances and assigned a rank to the four most 
serious. These judgments were based on the frequency with which a 
particular grievance was mentioned, the relative intensity with which it 
was discussed, references to incidents exemplifying the grievance, and 
estimates of severity obtained from the interviewees themselves. Each 
priority ranking was weighted by points (4 points for the first priority, 3 
for second, 2 for third and 1 for fourth). The points for each grievance for 
all cities were added to create an inter-city ranking. Whenever two griev- 
ances were judged to be equally serious for a particular city, the points 
for the two rankings involved were divided equally (e.g., in case two were 
judged equally suitable for the first priority, the total points for first and 
second were divided and each received 3>5 points). 

195 


Annexed are two sets of charts: Chart I shows the pervasiveness of types 
of grievances in 12 general categories, each of which is subdivided into 
several specific categories. Chart II shows only the general categories and 
indicates the number of times that grievances in each were ranked first, 
second, third, or fourth in terms of relative severity. 

207. Education and recreation were ranked equally; municipal services and 
consumer and credit practices were also ranked equally.

210. Ibid. 

211. In this survey 437 Negroes form the Detroit disturbance area were asked 
which of 23 grievances had a "great deal," "something" or "nothing" to 
do with the riot. The grievances which received the most responses of "a 
great deal" were: (1) police brutality, (2) overcrowded living conditions, 
(3) poor housing, (4) lack of jobs, (5) poverty, and (6) anger with business 
people. Interviewees who identified themselves as participants in the riot 
were singled out for special analysis and chose the same six causes but in a 
slightly different order. Overcrowded living conditions was first instead of 
police brutality. 

212. We found significant grievances concerning police practices in each of 19 
cities. Grievances concerning police practices were ranked first in eight 
cities, second in four cities, third in none, and fourth in two cities. Although 
such grievances were present in five other cities, they were not ranked in 
the first four orders of intensity. 

213. Grievances in the employment area were ranked first in three cities, 
second in seven cities, third in four cities, and fourth in three cities. In 
only three cities was such a grievance present but not ranked among the 
highest four levels of intensity. 

214. Grievances in the housing area were found in 18 cities and were ranked 
first in five cities, second in two cities, third in five cities, and fourth in 
two cities. In four cities where housing was a grievance, it was not ranked in 
the first four levels of intensity. 

215. Educational grievances were found in 17 cities and were ranked first in two 
cities, second in two cities, third in two cities, and fourth in three cities. In 
eight cities where such a grievance was present, it was not ranked in the 
first four levels of priority. 

216. Grievances relating to recreation were found in 15 cities and were ranked 
first in three cities, second in one city, third in four cities, and fourth in 
none. In seven cities where such a grievance was present, it was not ranked 
in the first four levels of priority. 

217. Grievances relating to the political structure were found in 16 cities and 
were ranked first in two cities, second in one city, third in one city, and 
fourth in one city. In 11 cities where such a grievance was present, it was 
not ranked in the first four levels of priority. 

218. Grievances relating to white attitudes were found in 15 cities and were 
ranked first in no city, second in one city, third in one city, and fourth 
in two cities. In 11 cities where such a grievance was present, it was not 
ranked in the first four levels of priority. 

219. Grievances relating to the administration of justice were found in 15 cities 
and were ranked &st in no city, second in none, third in two cities, and 
fourth in one city. In 12 cities where such a grievance was present, it was 
not ranked in the first four levels of priority. 

220. Grievances relating to federal programs were found in 16 cities and were 
ranked first in no city, second in one city, third in none, and fourth in 
none. In 15 cities where such a grievance was present, it was not ranked in 
the first four levels of priority. 

221. Grievances relating to municipal services were found in 11 cities and were 
ranked first in no city, second in none, third in one city, and fourth in none. 
In 10 cities where such a grievance was present, it was not ranked in the 
first four levels of priority. 

222. Grievances relating to unfair commercial practices were found in 11 cities 
and were ranked first in no city, second in none, third in none and fourth in 
two cities. In nine cities where such a grievance was present, it was not 
ranked in the first four levels of priority. 

223. We surveyed these cities shortly after the disturbances. Consequently, we 
are not in a position to assess more current events there. As noted elsewhere 
in this Report, the Commission is sponsoring two surveys . which will 
measure the impact of the disorders on the attitudes of whites and Negroes. 
The surveys are being conducted in 15 cities and four suburban areas, 
including four of the 20 cities surveyed for this Report. The results of 
these surveys will be published separately and will provide a more complete 

L    treatment of the post-disorder situation. 

196 


224. We have noted earlier that no immunization took effect for the 25 cities 
which experienced two or more disorders in 1967. See "Levels of Violence 
and Damage" in Part I, supra. Six of the 20 cities we surveyed had more 
than one disorder (Atlanta (2), Cambridge (2), Cincinnati (3), Dayton 
(2), Rockford (2), and Tampa (2)). Houston had three disorders in 1967. 
However, the three cities which had campus-related disorders in our 
sample of 23 have not been included in our examination for the purpose 
of this section. 

225. Bridgeton, Cincinnati, Tucson (one major and two minor). In Bridgeton, 
a white segregationist organization had become more active. In Cincinnati 
and Tucson, new black organizations tended to follow militant separatist 
policies. 

226. In Atlanta, two new groups were formed, one composed largely of white 
ministers and lay members, and the other of black youths. Reportedly, the 
latter group is dedicated to the maintenance of law and order and the 
prevention of riots. 

In Elizabeth, as a result of its leader's anti-riot activities during the 
disturbance, a relatively moderate religious sect, the Orthodox Moslems, 
appears to have gained stature in the Negro community. 

227. In New Haven, at least two black militant organizations emerged after the 
riot and they seemed to have gained support from members of the moderate 
Negro community. In addition, an integrated group was formed several 
months after the riot to protest alleged police harassment and repression 
of the militant Negro leaders. 

In Milwaukee, the NAACP Youth Commandoes, a militant but non- 
separatist group, appeared to have £rown in influence in the Negro com- 
munity after the riot. Also, a coalition of moderate Negro leaders was 
formed to develop economic and social programs. 

228. Atlanta, Milwaukee, New Haven, Newark, Paterson, Plainfield, Rockford 
and Tucson (three major, three serious, and two minor). 

In New Haven, the Police Department opened a store-front office in the 

disturbance area where citizens could make complaints or seek assistance. 

The office was also designed to serve as a "cooling-off" center to avoid 

the need for a trip to the central stationhouse'in minor matters such as 

domestic quarrels. 

In  Milwaukee,  the police department established a police-community 

relations division. 

In Newark, the Negro captain, whose promotion was announced during 

the riot, has been appointed commanding officer of the fourth precinct in 

which the disorders of the summer started. 

In Paterson, the program for the police community relations unit has 

been expanded to include a police-community relations board consisting 

of seven policemen and nine civilians. The civilians include representatives 

from the Negro community. 

In  Rockford,  the mayor's commission on human relations planned a 

workshop on police-community relations to be conducted by experts from 

city, county, state and federal agencies. Each member of the Rockford 

police force was to be required to take 12 hours of instruction. 

In Tucson, the police department planned to sponsor an institute of 

police-community relations, including seminars on the nature of prejudice 

and on the attitudes of Negroes, Mexican-Americans and Indians toward 

the police. 

In  Plainfield,  the police department began actively  recruiting Negro 

officers. The department also republished its complaint procedures. 

229. Cambridge, Cincinnati, Detroit, Grand Rapids, New Brunswick, Paterson, 
Phoenix, Tampa and Tucson (three major, four serious and two minor). 
In Cambridge and Tampa, the local community relations commissions 
increased their efforts to induce employers to hire more Negroes. Tampa's 
commission employed a full-time job developer and established a job 
training program. 

In Grand Rapids, a coalition of public and private organizations began a 
crash employment program to find 1,000 jobs in three months. 
In New Brunswick, the business community sought to raise $75,000 for 
job training; $25,000 of this amount was contributed by one local pharma- 
ceutical company. 

In Phoenix, the anti-poverty program initiated a project to train 2,500 
heads of households in ghetto areas. 

After the Tampa disturbance, the local anti-poverty agency and area 
industries sponsored an on-the-job training program, and the Tampa 
Merchants Association established a job training course. 

230. Cambridge, Cincinnati, Dayton, Detroit, Elizabeth, Milwaukee, Plain- 
field, Tampa and Rockford (five major, two serious and two minor). 

In Cincinnati, the urban renewal agency established a complaint office in 

197 


ooe/    °* office, which was open three days a week, was closed after 

38 days of operation. The city manager said the experiment was abandoned 
because citizens had failed to use it. 

In Elizabeth, the city council approved the local housing authority's 
request to submit an application to the federal government for 400 low- 
income apartment units. The mayor also appointed a Negro to the local 
redevelopment agency. 

In Milwaukee, the city council passed an open housing ordinance. How- 
ever, Negro leaders denounced the ordinance on the ground that it merely 
restates the provisions of state law, which reportedly exclude 66 percent 
of the housing in Milwaukee from coverage. The lone Negro council member 
voted against the ordinance as "mere tokenism." 

In Plainfield, a Negro was appointed to a five-year term as a member of 
the housing authority. 

In Tampa, a block club staged a march on the Tampa housing authority's 
offices to publicize complaints against the authority, such as billing public 
housing residents for grass-cutting where there is no grass. The authority 
promised to consider the charges seriously. 

In Rockford, the county housing authority is constructing a 75-unit housing 
development for the elderly in a Negro slum. The project was planned 
before the disturbance but construction began afterward. A community 
development corporation was also initiated before the disorder to en- 
courage community self-help programs for home improvement, and local 
businesses contributed "seed money" to guarantee improvement loans. 
The city annexed the pilot project block in order to provide municipal 
services and planned to annex additional blocks as the program expands. 

231. Newark is the headquarters office for two of the life insurance companies 
in the consortium of 350 which pledged to set aside $1 billion to finance 
ghetto housing under FHA insurance. 

232. Dayton, Detroit, Elizabeth, Plainfield and Rockford (two major, one 
serious and two minor). 

The Dayton board of education issued a policy statement that it would 

attempt to decrease de facto segregation in city schools. 

Elizabeth's board of education instituted a program of free adult basic 

education. 

The Plainfield board of education formalized its practice of permitting 

parents to have a third person present when talking to school officials. It 

also hired its first full-time Negro counsellor. 

233. In Detroit, as aforementioned, the Michigan Bell Telephone Company 
plans to "adopt" one of the city's high schools and provide funds for special 
programs. 

234. Atlanta, Cincinnati, Dayton and Tampa (two major and two serious). 
In Atlanta, despite united resistance by local Negro leaders, the administra- 
tion continued to build "portable" classrooms for use at predominantly 
black schools, maintained: double sessions only in Negro schools, and 
refused to reconsider its "freedom of choice" desegregation procedures. 
In Dayton and Tampa, bond issues for school construction were defeated. 
The Tampa referendum was opposed by local Negroes because most of the 
money was to be used in all-white, suburban schools. 

Also in Tampa, the interscholastic athletic conference to which Tampa's 
white schools belong refused to admit the city's predominantly Negro 
schools to membership and made it impossible for the county schools to 
form a separate conference in which the Negro schools could participate 
in the highest class of competition. 

235. Atlanta, Elizabeth, New Brunswick and Tampa (one major, one serious 
and two minor). 

In Atlanta, immediately after the disturbance, work began on a play- 
ground for which area residents had been petitioning for two years. 
In Elizabeth, shortly after the disturbance, the recreation department 
moved a playground closer to a poor Negro neighborhood. 
In Tampa, a former local high school coach, popular among Negro youths, 
was hired as director of youth services for the neighborhood service centers 
of the county anti-poverty program. 

236. Cincinnati, Englewood, Phoenix, Tampa and Tucson (two major, one 
serious and two minor). ,  . 

237. President of city council in Englewood, member of civil service commission 
in Tucson and members of housing authority and board of adjustments in 
Plainfield (one major and two minor). _ 
In elections for state office, the situation was mixed. A Negro candidate 
for state assemblyman from Newark was elected, but two incumbent Negro 
legislators from Newark were defeated. The incumbent Negro assemblyman 
whose district included Englewood was defeated by the candidate who had 
been mayor of that city during the disorder. 

198 


238. Cambridge and New Brunswick (one serious and one minor). 

In Cambridge, the Governor of Maryland appointed a community relations 
committee immediately after the disturbance. 

In New Brunswick, the mayor established an "open door" policy to 
facilitate the airing of grievances directly with her. A human relations com- 
mission, planned prior to the disturbance, was established, and several 
Negroes were appointed as commissioners. 

239. In Tampa, some of the counter-rioters known as "White Hats" were hired 
by the city's commission on community relations to improve communica- 
tion with ghetto youths. The program was recently terminated upon the 
indictment of several White Hats on felony charges not connected with 
the disorder. 

240. Atlanta, Dayton, Detroit, Elizabeth, Englewood, New Haven, Newark 
and Tampa (three major, three serious and two minor). 

In six of the cities surveyed (Atlanta, Dayton. Detroit, New Haven, New- 
ark and Tampa) Model Cities applications nave been approved by the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. 

In Elizabeth and Tampa, new legal services programs, funded by the 
Office of Economic Opportunity, were instituted. 

A YMHA building, valued at $50,000, near Elizabeth's disturbance area 
was donated for use by the local community action agency as a community 
center. 
The county community action agency opened an office in EnglewoocL 

241. Tampa and Milwaukee (two major). 

The nomination to the board of the county community action agency of 
the former commander of the Milwaukee police precinct which includes 
much of the ghetto area was resented by Negro residents. The nomination 
was never voted on as the nominee moved from the city before a vote was 
taken. 

In Tampa, a highly-publicized controversy arose because a Negro neighbor- 
hood worker was fired by a local anti-poverty agency. The discharged 
employee filed charges of racial discrimination in the hiring and job place- 
ment practices of the county anti-poverty program. 

242. Atlanta, Dayton, Elizabeth and New Brunswick (two serious and two 
minor). 

Elizabeth opened a "little city hall" in the disturbance area. 

In^ New Brunswick, the administration rented an armory for use as a 

neighborhood center. 

243. In Elizabeth, the county legal services agency announced plans for one- 
day consumer clinics in various low-income neighborhoods for training 
and counselling on complaints about credit and other consumer practices. 

244. Cincinnati and Detroit (two major). 

In Detroit, as stated, CCAC began developing proposals for new businesses 
in the riot area, including a Negro-owned cooperative food market and a 
number of other cooperative business ventures. 

In Cincinnati, newspapers reported that two Negroes who had long 
sought financing for a new business center in the disturbance area had 
succeeded since the disturbance. 

245. Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Newark and Tampa (four major and one 
serious). 

In Atlanta, the police and fire departments announced the formulation of a 
confidential coordinated plan to cope with any future disturbance. 
In Cincinnati, voters approved a bond issue to establish a countrywide 
police communications center and command post for normal conditions as 
well as riot conditions. The new city budget included $500,000 for 50 
additional policemen. 

In Newark, the city council appropriated $200,000 for the purchase of 
armored cars, riot guns, helmets and other riot control equipment. 
In Tampa, city and county law enforcement departments prepared a 
detailed "After-action Report" describing the city's disorder and how^ it 
was controlled. The report recommended purchase of riot control equip- 
ment and suggested tactical improvements. 

246. Dayton, Elizabeth, Paterson and Tampa (one major, two serious and one 
minor). 

In Dayton, the organizers of the White Hats stated that the group would 

be used again if another riot occurred. The organizers also stated that they 

expected city officials to cooperate with them again as they had during 

the June disorder. 

In Elizabeth, there was evidence that city officials planned to ask Negro 

community leaders to assist in future peace keeping as they did during the 

disorder. 

In Paterson, the community action agency gave a leadership course for 

Negro teenagers in the hope that the youths will act as counter-rioters 

should the need arise. 

199 


247. In Tampa, as indicated above, the White Hats program, which had been 
continued after the disorder, ended with the indictment of several youths 
on non-riot-connected charges. 

248. In Cincinnati, according to unofficial estimates, about 50 percent of the 
businesses damaged during that city's riot had reopened by mid-December, 
1967. 

In Dayton, where the total estimated property damage from the June 
disorder was relatively small, most of the storefronts damaged in the West 
Dayton business area were repaired. 

249. Detroit and Plainfield (two major). 

In Plainfield, two Negro organizations demanded that any new building 

be undertaken only after consultation with representatives of the Negro 

community. 

In Detroit, CC AC insisted that no rebuilding be started until Negro citizens 

of the area decided how they want their neighborhoods redeveloped. 


200 


Chapter 3 / Organized Activity 


The President directed the Commission to investigate "to 
what extent, if any, there has been planning or organization 
in any of the riots." 

The President further directed the Federal Bureau of In- 
vestigation to provide investigative information and assistance 
to the Commission and authorized the Commission to request 
from any other executive department or agency any infor- 
mation and assistance which the Commission deemed neces- 
sary to carry out its functions. 

The Commission obtained documents, numbering in the 
thousands, from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the De- 
partment of State, the Department of Defense, the Depart- 
ment of the Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service, the Post 
Office Department, the Legislative Reference Service of the 
Library of Congress, and the Central Intelligence Agency. The 
Commission established a special investigating staff supple- 
menting the Commission's field teams and related staff that 
made the general examination of the riots in 23 cities. The 
special investigating staff examined the data supplied by the 
field teams, by the several federal agencies, and by congression- 
al investigating units, and maintained continuous liaison with 
these organizations throughout its investigation. 

In addition to examining and evaluating intelligence and in- 
formation from federal sources, the special investigating staff 
gathered information from local and state law enforcement 
agencies and officials. It also conducted its own field investi- 
gations in 15 cities with special emphasis on five that had ex- 
perienced major disorders in 1967 — Cincinnati, Newark, De- 
troit, Milwaukee, and New Haven. Special staff investigators 
employed by the Commission interviewed over 400 persons, 
including police officials, black militants, and ghetto residents. 

The Commission studied the role of foreign and domestic 
organizations, and individuals, dedicated to the incitement or 
encouragement of violence. It considered the organizational 
affiliations of those who called for violence, their contacts, 
sources of financial support, travel schedules and, so far as 
possible, their effect on audiences. 

The Commission considered the incidents that had triggered 
the disorders and the patterns of damage during disorders, 
particularly in Newark and Detroit. The Commission analyzed 
the extent of sniper activity and the use of fire bombs. 

201 


The Commission collected and investigated hundreds of 
rumors relating to possible organized activity. These included 
reports of arms caches, sniper gangs, guerrilla training camps, 
selection of targets for destruction, movement of armed indi- 
viduals from one riot area to another, and pre-riot planning. 

On the basis of all the information collected the Commission 
concludes that the urban disorders of the summer of 1967 
were not caused by, nor were they the consequence of, any 
organized plan or "conspiracy." Specifically, the Commission 
has found no evidence that all or any of the disorders or the 
incidents that led to them were planned or directed by any 
organization or group, international, national or local. 

Militant organizations, local and national, and individual 
agitators, who repeatedly forecast and called for violence, were 
active in the spring and summer of 1967. We believe that they 
deliberately sought to encourage violence, and that they did 
have an effect in creating an atmosphere that contributed to 
the outbreak of disorder. 

We recognize that the continuation of disorders and the 
polarization of the races would provide fertile ground for 
organized exploitation in the future. 

Since the disorders, intensive investigations have been con- 
ducted not only by this Commission but also by local police 
departments, grand juries, city and state committees, federal 
departments and agencies, and congressional committees. None 
thus far has identified any organized groups as having initiated 
any riots during the summer of 1967. The Commission ap- 
pointed by Governor Richard J. Hughes to examine the dis- 
orders in New Jersey was unable to find evidence supporting a 
conclusion that there was a conspiracy or plan to organize the 
Newark or Plainfield riots. 

Investigations are continuing at all levels of government, 
including committees of Congress. These investigations relate 
not only to the disorders of 1967 but also to the actions of 
groups and individuals, particularly in schools and colleges, 
during this last fall and winter. The Commission has cooperated 
in these investigations. They should continue.

PART II 

WHY DID IT HAPPEN? 


Chapter 4 / The Basic Causes 


We have seen what happened. Why did it happen? 

In addressing this question we shift our focus from the local 
to the national scene, from the particular events of the summer 
of 1967 to the factors within the society at large which have 
brought about the sudden violent mood of so many urban 
Negroes. 

The record before this Commission reveals that the causes 
of recent racial disorders are imbedded in a massive tangle of 
issues and circumstances — social, economic, political, and 
psychological — which arise out of the historical pattern of 
Negro-white relations in America. 

These factors are both complex and interacting; they vary 
significantly in their effect from city to city and from year to 
year; and the consequences of one disorder, generating new 
grievances and new demands, become the causes of the next. 
It is this which creates the "thicket of tension, conflicting 
evidence and extreme opinions" cited by the President. 

Despite these complexities, certain fundamental matters 
are clear. Of these, the most fundamental is the racial attitude 
and behavior of white Americans toward black Americans. 
Race prejudice has shaped our history decisively in the past; 
it now threatens to do so again. White racism is essentially 
responsible for the explosive mixture which has been accumu- 
lating in our cities since the end of World War II. At the 
base of this mixture are three of the most bitter fruits of white 
racial attitudes: 

Pervasive discrimination and segregation. The first is surely 
the continuing exclusion of great numbers of Negroes from 
the benefits of economic progress through discrimination in 
employment and education, and their enforced confinement 
in segregated housing and schools. The corrosive and degrad- 
ing effects of this condition and the attitudes that underlie it 
are the source of the deepest bitterness and at the center of 
the problem of racial disorder. 

203 


Black migration and white exodus. The second is the mas- 
sive and growing concentration of impoverished Negroes in 
our major cities resulting from Negro migration from the 
rural South, rapid population growth and the continuing move- 
ment of the white middle-class to the suburbs. The conse- 
quence is a greatly increased burden on the already depleted 
resources of cities, creating a growing crisis of deteriorating 
facilities and services and unmet human needs. 

Black ghettos. Third, in the teeming racial ghettos, segrega- 
tion and poverty have intersected to destroy opportunity and 
hope and to enforce failure. The ghettos too often mean men 
and women without jobs, families without men, and schools 
where children are processed instead of educated, until they 
return to the street — to crime, to narcotics, to dependency on 
welfare, and to bitterness and resentment against society in 
general and white society in particular. 

These three forces have converged on the inner city in 
recent years and on the people who inhabit it. At the same 
time, most whites and many Negroes outside the ghetto have 
prospered to a degree unparalleled in the history of civiliza- 
tion. Through television — the universal appliance in the ghetto 
— and the other media of mass communications, this affluence 
has been endlessly flaunted before the eyes of the Negro poor 
and the jobless ghetto youth. 

As Americans, most Negro citizens carry within themselves 
two basic aspirations of our society. They seek to share in both 
the material resources of our system and its intangible benefits 
— dignity, respect and acceptance. Outside the ghetto many 
have succeeded in achieving a decent standard of life, and in 
developing the inner resources which give life meaning and 
direction. Within the ghetto, however, it is rare that either 
aspiration is achieved. 

Yet these facts alone — fundamental as they are — cannot be 
said to have caused the disorders. Other and more immediate 
factors help explain why these events happened now. 

Recently, three powerful ingredients have begun to catalyze 
the mixture. 

Frustrated hopes. The expectations aroused by the great 
judicial and legislative victories of the civil rights movement 
have led to frustration, hostility and cynicism in the face of 
the persistent gap between promise and fulfillment. The dra- 
matic struggle for equal rights in the South has sensitized 
Northern Negroes to the economic inequalities reflected in the 
deprivations of ghetto life. 

Legitimation of violence. A climate that tends toward the 
approval and encouragement of violence as a form of protest 
has been created by white terrorism directed against nonviolent 

204 


protest, including instances of abuse and even murder of some 
civil rights workers in the South; by the open defiance of law 
and federal authority by state and local officials resisting de- 
segregation; and by some protest groups engaging in civil 
disobedience who turn their backs on nonviolence, go beyond 
the Constitutionally protected rights of petition and free as- 
sembly, and resort to violence to attempt to compel alteration 
of laws and policies with which they disagree. This condition 
has been reinforced by a general erosion of respect for au- 
thority in American society and reduced effectiveness of social 
standards and community restraints on violence and crime. 
This in turn has largely resulted from rapid urbanization and 
the dramatic reduction in the average age of the total popula- 
tion. 

Powerlessness. Finally, many Negroes have come to believe 
that they are being exploited politically and economically by 
the white "power structure." Negroes, like people in poverty 
everywhere, in fact lack the channels of communication, in- 
fluence and appeal that traditionally have been available to 
ethnic minorities within the city and which enabled them — 
unburdened by color — to scale the walls of the white ghettos 
in an earlier era. The frustrations of powerlessness have led 
some to the conviction that there is no effective alternative to 
violence as a means of expression and redress, as a way of 
"moving the system." More generally, the result is alienation 
and hostility toward the institutions of law and government 
and the white society which controls them. This is reflected 
in the reach toward racial consciousness and solidarity re- 
flected in the slogan "Black Power." 

These facts have combined to inspire a new mood among 
Negroes, particularly among the young. Self-esteem and en- 
hanced racial pride are replacing apathy and submission to 
"the system." Moreover, Negro youth, who make up over half 
of the ghetto population, share the growing sense of alienation 
felt by many white youth in our country. Thus, their role in 
recent civil disorders reflects not only a shared sense of dep- 
rivation and victimization by white society but also the rising 
incidence of disruptive conduct by a segment of American 
youth throughout the society. 

Incitement and encouragement of violence. These condi- 
tions have created a volatile mixture of attitudes and beliefs 
which needs only a spark to ignite mass violence. Strident 
appeals to violence, first heard from white racists, were echoed 
and reinforced last summer in the inflammatory rhetoric of 
black racists and militants. Throughout the year, extremists 
crisscrossed the country preaching a doctrine of violence. Their 
rhetoric was widely reported in the mass media; it was echoed 

205 


by local "militants" and organizations; it became the ugly 
background noise of the violent summer. 

We cannot measure with any precision the influence of these 
organizations and individuals in the ghetto, but we think it 
clear that the intolerable and unconscionable encouragement 
of violence heightened tensions, created a mood of acceptance 
and an expectation of violence, and thus contributed to the 
eruption of the disorders last summer. 

The police. It is the convergence of all these factors that 
makes the role of the police so difficult and so significant. Al- 
most invariably the incident that ignites disorder arises from 
police action. Harlem, Watts, Newark and Detroit — all the 
major outbursts of recent years — were precipitated by arrests 
of Negroes by white police for minor offenses. 

But the police are not merely the spark. In discharge of their 
obligation to maintain order and insure public safety in the 
disruptive conditions of ghetto life, they are inevitably involved 
in sharper and more frequent conflicts with ghetto residents 
than with the residents of other areas. Thus, to many Negroes 
police have come to symbolize white power, white racism and 
white repression. And the fact is that many police do reflect 
and express these white attitudes. The atmosphere of hostility 
and cynicism is reinforced by a widespread perception among 
Negroes of the existence of police brutality and corruption, 
and of a "double standard" of justice and protection — one for 
Negroes and one for whites. 


To this point, we have attempted only to identify the prime 
components of the "explosive mixture." In the chapter that 
follows we seek to analyze them in the perspective of history. 
Their meaning, however, is already clear: 

In the summer of 1967, we have seen in our cities a chain 
reaction of racial violence. If we are heedless, we shall none 
of us escape the consequences.

Chapter 5 / Rejection and Protest: An 
Historical Sketch 

Introduction 

The events of the summer of 1967 are in large part the 
culmination of 300 years of racial prejudice. Most Americans 
know little of the origins of the racial schism separating our 
white and Negro citizens. Few appreciate how central the 
problem of the Negro has been to our social policy. Fewer still 
understand that today's problems can be solved only if white 
Americans comprehend the rigid social, economic, and educa- 
tional barriers that have prevented Negroes from participating 
in the mainstream of American life. Only a handful realize 
that Negro accommodation to the patterns of prejudice in 
American culture has been but one side of the coin — for as 
slaves and as free men, Negroes have protested against oppres- 
sion and have persistently sought equality in American society. 

What follows is neither a history of the Negro in the United 
States nor a full account of Negro protest movements. Rather, 
it is a brief narrative of a few historical events that illustrate 
the facts of rejection and the forms of protest. 

We call on history not to justify, but to help explain, for 
black and white Americans, a state of mind. 

The Colonial Period 

Twenty years after Columbus reached the New World, 
African Negroes, transported by Spanish, Dutch, and Portu- 
guese traders, were arriving in the Caribbean Islands. Almost 
all came as slaves. By 1600, there were more than half a mil- 
lion slaves in the Western Hemisphere. 

In Colonial America the first Negroes landed at Jamestown 
in August 1619. Within 40 years Negroes had become a group 
apart, separated from the rest of the population by custom and 
law. Treated as servants for life, forbidden to intermarry with 
whites, deprived of their African traditions, and dispersed 
among Southern plantations, American Negroes lost tribal, 
regional, and family ties. 

Through massive importation, their numbers increased 
rapidly. By 1776, some 500,000 Negroes were held in slavery 
and indentured servitude in the United States. Nearly one of 
every six persons in the country was a slave. 

207 


Americans disapproved a preliminary draft of the Declara- 
tion of Independence that indicted the King of England for 
waging "cruel war against human nature itself, violating its 
most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant 
people who never offended him, captivating and carrying them 
into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death 
in their transportation thither." Instead, they approved a docu- 
ment that proclaimed "all men are created equal." 

The statement was an ideal, a promise. But it excluded the 
Negroes who were held in bondage, as well as the few who 
were free men. 

The conditions in which Negroes lived had already led to 
protest. Racial violence was present almost from the beginning 
of the American experience. Throughout the 18th century, the 
danger of Negro revolts obsessed many white Americans. Slave 
plots of considerable scope were uncovered in New York in 
1712 and 1714, and they resulted in bloodshed — whites and 
Negroes were slain. 

Negroes were at first barred from serving in the Revolution- 
ary Army, recruiting officers having been ordered in July 1775 
to enlist no "stroller, Negro, or vagabond." Yet Negroes were 
already actively involved in the struggle for independence. 
Crispus Attucks, a Boston Negro, was perhaps the first Amer- 
ican to die for freedom, and Negroes had already fought in the 
battles at Lexington and Concord. They were among the 
soldiers at Bunker Hill. 

Fearing that Negroes would enlist in the British Army, 
which welcomed them, and facing a manpower shortage, the 
Continental Army accepted free Negroes. Many slaves did join 
the British, and according to an estimate by Thomas Jefferson, 
more than 30,000 Virginia slaves ran away in 1778 alone, 
presumably to enlist. The states were enrolling both free and 
slave Negroes, and finally Congress authorized military service 
for slaves, who were to be emancipated in return for their 
service. By the end of the war, about 5,000 Negroes had been 
in the ranks of the Continental Army. Those who had been 
slaves became free. 

The Constitution and the Laws 

Massachusetts abolished slavery in 1783, and Connecticut, 
Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York soon 
provided for gradual liberation. But relatively few Negroes 
lived in these states. The bulk of the Negro population was in 

208 


the South, where white Americans had fortunes invested in 
slaves. Although the Congress banned slavery in the North- 
west Territory, delegates at the Constitutional Convention com- 
promised— a slave was counted as three-fifths of a person 
for determining the number of representatives from a state 
to Congress; Congress was prohibited from restricting the 
slave trade until after 1808, and the free states were required 
to return fugitive slaves to their Southern owners. 

Growing numbers of slaves in the South became permanent- 
ly fastened in bondage, and slavery spread into the new 
Southern regions. When more slaves were needed for the 
cotton and sugar plantations in the Southwest, they were 
ordered from the "Negro-raising" states of the Old South or, 
despite Congressional prohibition of the slave trade, imported 
from Africa. 

The laws of bondage became even more institutionalized. 
Masters retained absolute authority over their Negroes, who 
were unable to leave their masters' properties without written 
permission. Any white person, even those who owned no 
slaves — and they outnumbered slaveholders six to one— could 
challenge a truant slave and turn him over to a public official. 
Slaves could own no property, could enter into no contract, 
not even a contract of marriage, and had no right to assemble 
in public unless a white person was present. They had no 
standing in the courts. 

Discrimination as Doctrine 

The situation was hardly better for free Negroes. A few 
achieved material success, some even owned slaves themselves, 
but the vast majority knew only poverty. Forbidden to settle in 
some areas, segregated in others, they were targets of prejudice 
and discrimination. In the South, they were denied freedom of 
movement, severely restricted in their choice of occupation, 
and forbidden to associate with whites or with slaves. They 
lived in constant danger of being enslaved — whites could chal- 
lenge their freedom and an infraction of the law could put them 
into bondage. In both North and South, they were regularly 
victims of mobs. In 1829, for example, white residents in- 
vaded Cincinnati's "Little Africa," killed Negroes, burned 
their property, and ultimately drove half the colored population 
from the city. 

Some Americans, Washington and Jefferson among them, 
advocated the gradual emancipation of slaves, and in the 19th 

209 


century, a movement to abolish slavery grew in importance 
and strength. A few white abolitionist leaders wanted full 
equality for Negroes, but others sought only to eliminate the 
institution itself. And some anti-slavery societies, fearing that 
Negro members would unnecessarily offend those who were 
unsympathetic with abolitionist principles, denied entrance to 
Negroes. 

Most Americans were, in fact, against abolishing slavery. 
They refused to rent their halls for anti-slavery meetings. 
They harassed abolitionist leaders who sought to educate white 
and Negro children together. They attacked those involved in 
the movement. Mobs sometimes killed abolitionists and de- 
stroyed their property. 

A large body of literature came into existence to prove 
that the Negro was imperfectly developed in mind and body, 
that he belonged to a lower order of man, that slavery was 
right on ethnic, economic, and social grounds — and quoted 
the Scriptures in support. 

Spreading rapidly during the first part of the 19th century, 
slavery held less than one million Negroes in 1800, but al- 
most four million in 1860. Although some few white Amer- 
icans had freed their slaves, most increased their holdings, 
for the invention of the cotton gin had made cotton the heart 
of the Southern economy. By mid-century, slavery in the South 
had become a systematic and aggressive way of treating a 
whole race of people. 

The despair of Negroes was evident. Malingering and 
sabotage tormented every slaveholder. The problem of run- 
away slaves was endemic. Some slaves — Gabriel Prosser in 
1800, Denmark Vesey in 1822, Nat Turner in 1831, and 
others — turned to violence, and the sporadic uprisings that 
flared demonstrated a deep protest against a demeaning way 
of life. 

Negroes who had material resources expressed their dis- 
tress in other ways. In 1816, Paul Cuffee, Negro philanthropist 
and owner of a fleet of ships, transported a group of Negroes 
to a new home in Sierra Leone. Forty years later Martin R. 
Delany, Negro editor and physician urged Negroes to settle 
elsewhere. 

Equality of treatment and acceptance by the society at 
large were myths, and Negro protest during the first half of 
the 19th century took the form of rhetoric, spoken and writ- 
ten, which combined denunciation of undemocratic oppres- 
sion together with pleas to the conscience of white Americans 
for the redress of grievances and the recognition of their con- 
stitutional rights. 

210 


A few Negroes joined white Americans who believed that 
only Negro emigration to Africa would solve racial problems. 
But most Negroes equated that program with banishment and 
felt themselves "entitled to participate in the blessings'' of 
America. The National Negro Convention Movement, formed 
in 1830, held conferences to publicize on a national scale the 
evils of slavery and the indignities heaped on free Negroes. 

The American Moral Reform Society, founded by Negroes 
in 1834, rejected racial separatism and advocated uplifting 
"the whole human race, without distinction as to . . . com- 
plexion." Other Negro reformers pressed for stronger racial 
consciousness and solidarity as the means to overcome racial 
barriers. Many took direct action to help slaves escape through 
the Underground Railroad. A few resisted discrimination by 
political action, even though most Negroes were barred from 
voting. 

Frustration, disillusionment, anger, and fantasy marked the 
Negroes' protest against the place in American society assigned 
to them. "I was free," Harriet Tubman said, "but there was 
no one to welcome me in the land of freedom. I was a stranger 
in a strange land." 

When Frederick Douglass, the distinguished Negro aboli- 
tionist, addressed the citizens of Rochester on Independence 
Day, 1852, he told them: 

The Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, / must 
mourn. To drag a man into the grand illuminated temple of 
liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems, were 
inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. . . . Fellow citizens, 
above your national tumultuous joy, I hear the mournful wail of 
millions, whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are today 
rendered more intolerable by the jubilant shouts that reach 
them. . • . 

The Path Toward Civil War 

The 1850's brought Negroes increasing despair, as the prob- 
lem of slavery was debated by the nation's leaders. The Com- 
promise of 1850 and the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 settled 
no basic issues. And the Dred Scott case in 1857 confirmed 
Negroes in their understanding that they were not "citizens" 
and thus not entitled to the Constitutional safeguards enjoyed 
by other Americans. 

But the abolitionist movement was growing. "Uncle Tom's 
Cabin" appeared in 1852 and sold more than 300,000 copies 
that year. Soon presented on the stage throughout the North, 

211 


it dramatized the cruelty of slave masters and overseers and 
condemned a culture based on human degradation and ex- 
ploitation. The election of Abraham Lincoln on an anti-slavery 
platform gave hope that the end of slavery was near. 

But by the time Lincoln took office, seven Southern states 
had seceded from the Union, and four more soon joined them. 

The Civil War and Emancipation renewed Negro faith in 
the vision of a racially egalitarian and integrated American 
society. But Americans, after having been roused by wartime 
crisis, would again fail to destroy what abolitionists had de- 
scribed as the "sins of caste." 

Civil War and ''Emancipation0 

Negroes volunteered for military service during the Civil 
War, the struggle, as they saw it, between the slave states and 
the free states. They were rejected. 

Not until a shortage of troops plagued the Union Army 
late in 1862, were segregated units of "United States Colored 
Troops" formed. Not until 1864 did these men receive the 
same pay as white soldiers. A total of 186,000 Negroes served. 

The Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed few slaves 
at first, but had immediate significance as a symbol. Negroes 
could hope again for equality. 

But there were, at the same time, bitter signs of racial un- 
rest. Violent rioting occurred in Cincinnati in 1862, when 
Negro and Irish hands competed for work on the riverboats. 
Lesser riots took place in Newark, New Jersey, and in Buffalo 
and Troy, New York, the result of combined hostility to the 
war and fear that Negroes would take white jobs. 

The most violent of the troubles took place in New York 
City Draft Riots in July 1863, when white workers, mainly 
Irish-born, embarked on a three-day rampage. 

Desperately poor and lacking real roots in the community, 
they had the most to lose from the draft. Further, they were 
bitterly afraid that even cheaper Negro labor would flood the 
North if slavery ceased to exist 

All the frustrations and prejudices the Irish had suffered were 
brought to a boiling point. ... At pitiful wages, they had slaved 
on the railroads and canals, had been herded into the most menial 
jobs as carters and stevedores. . . . Their crumbling frame tene- 
ments . . . were the worst slums in the city.1

Their first target was the office of the provost-marshal in 
charge of conscription, and 700 people quickly ransacked the 
building and set it on fire. The crowd refused to permit fire- 
men into the area, and the whole block was gutted. Then the 
mob spilled into the Negro area, where many Negroes were 
slain and thousands forced to flee town. The police were help- 
less until federal troops arrived on the third day and restored 
control. 

Union victory in the Civil War promised the Negroes free- 
dom but not equality or immunity from white aggression. 
Scarcely was the war ended when racial violence erupted in 
New Orleans. Negroes proceeding to an assembly hall to dis- 
cuss the franchise were charged by police and special troops 
who routed the Negroes with guns, bricks, and stones, killed 
some at once, pursued and killed others who were trying to 
escape. 

Federal troops restored order. But 34 Negroes and four 
whites were reported dead and over 200 people were injured. 
General Sheridan later said: 

At least nine-tenths of the casualties were perpetrated by the 
police and citizens by stabbing and smashing in the heads of 
many who had already been wounded or killed by policemen . . . 
it was not just a riot but 'an absolute massacre by the police . . .' 
a murder which the mayor and police . . . perpetrated without 
the shadow of necessity. 

Reconstruction 

Reconstruction was a time of hope, the period when the 
13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments were adopted, giving 
Negroes the vote and the promise of equality. 

But campaigns of violence and intimidation accompanied 
these optimistic expressions of a new age, as the Ku Klux 
Klan and other secret organizations sought to suppress the 
emergence into society of the new Negro citizens. Major riots 
occurred in Memphis, Tennessee, where 46 Negroes were re- 
ported killed and 75 wounded, and in the Louisiana centers of 
Colfax and Coushatta, where more than 100 Negro and white 
Republicans were massacred. 

Nevertheless, in 1875, Congress enacted the first significant 
civil rights law. It gave Negroes the right to equal accommo- 
dations, facilities, and advantages of public transportation, 
inns, theaters, and places of public amusement, but the law had 
no effective enforcement provisions and was, in fact, poorly 
enforced. Although bills to provide federal aid to education 
for Negroes were prepared, none passed, and educational op- 

213 


portunities remained meager. But Negroes were elected to every 
Southern legislature, 20 served in the U.S. House of Repre- 
sentatives, two represented Mississippi in the U.S. Senate, and 
a prominent Negro politician was Governor of Louisiana for 
40 days. 

Opposition to Negroes in state and local government was 
always open and bitter. In the press and on the platform they 
were described as ignorant and depraved. Critics made no 
distinction between Negroes who had graduated from Dart- 
mouth and those who had graduated from the cotton fields. 
Every available means was employed to drive Negroes from 
public life. Negroes who voted or held office were refused jobs 
or punished by the Ku Klux Klan. One group in Mississippi 
boasted of having killed 116 Negroes and of having thrown 
their bodies into the Tallahatchie River. In a single South 
Carolina county, six men were murdered and more than 300 
whipped during the first six months of 1870. 

The federal government seemed helpless. Having withdrawn 
the occupation troops as soon as the Southern states organized 
governments, the President was reluctant to send them back. 
In 1870 and 1871, after the 15th Amendment was ratified, 
Congress enacted several laws to protect the right of citizens to 
vote. They were seldom enforced, and the Supreme Court 
struck down most of the important provisions in 1875 and 
1876. 

As Southern white governments returned to power, begin- 
ning with Virginia in 1869 and ending with Louisiana in 1877, 
the process of relegating the Negro to a subordinate place in 
American life was accelerated. Disenfranchisement was the 
first step. Negroes who defied the Klan and tried to vote faced 
an array of deceptions and obstacles — polling places were 
changed at the last minute without notice to Negroes, severe 
time limitations were imposed on marking complicated ballots, 
votes cast incorrectly in a maze of ballot boxes were nullified. 
The suffrage provisions of state constitutions were rewritten 
to disenfranchise Negroes who could not read, understand, or 
interpret the Constitution. Some state constitutions permitted 
those who failed the tests to vote if their ancestors had been 
eligible to vote on January 1, 1860 — a date when no Negro 
could vote anywhere in the South. 

In 1896, Negroes registered in Louisiana totalled 130,344. 
In 1900, after the state rewrote the suffrage provisions of its 
constitution, Negroes on the registration books numbered only 
5,320. Essentially the same thing happened in the other states 
of the former Confederacy. 

214 


Segregation by Law 

When the Supreme Court, in 1883, declared the Civil Rights 
Act of 1875 unconstitutional, Southern states began to enact 
laws to segregate the races. In 1896. the Supreme fYmrt in 
Plexsv v. Ferguson approved "separate but equal" facilities! 
it was then that segregation became an established fact, by law 
ps well as by cu5flomr Negroes and whites were separated on 
public carriers and in all places of public accommodation, in- 
cluding hospitals and churches. In courthouses, whites and 
Negroes took oaths on separate Bibles. In most communities, 
whites were separated from Negroes in cemeteries. 

Segregation invariably meant discrimination. On trains all 
Negroes, including those holding first-class tickets, were al- 
lotted seats in the baggage car. Negroes in public buildings 
had to use freight elevators and toilet facilities reserved 
for janitors. Schools for Negro children were at best a weak 
imitation of those for whites, as states spent 10 times more to 
educate white youngsters than Negroes. Discrimination in 
wages became the rule, whether between Negro and white 
teachers of similar training and experience or between common 
laborers on the same job. 

Some Northern states enacted civil rights laws in the 1880's, 
but Negroes in fact were treated little differently in the North 
than in the South. As Negroes moved north in substantial num- 
bers toward the end of the century, they discovered that equal- 
ity of treatment did not exist in Massachusetts, New York, 
or Illinois. They were crowded by local ordinances into 
sections of the city where housing and public services were 
generally sub-standard. Overt discrimination in employment 
was a general practice. Employment opportunities apart from 
menial tasks were few. Most labor unions excluded Negroes 
from membership — or granted membership in separate and 
powerless Jim Crow locals. Yet when Negroes secured employ- 
ment during strikes, labor leaders castigated them for under- 
mining the principles of trade unionism. And when Ne- 
groes sought to move into the mainstream of community life 
by seeking membership in the organizations around them — 
educational, cultural, and religious — they were invariably re- 
buffed. 

By the 20th century, the Negro was at the bottom of Amer- 
ican society. Disfranchised, Negroes throughout the country 
were excluded by employers and labor unions from white collar 
jobs and skilled trades. Jim Crow laws and farm tenancy char- 
acterized Negro existence in the South. About 100 lynchings 

215 


occurred every year in the 1880's and 1890's; there were 161 
lynchings in 1892. As increasing numbers of Negroes migrated 
to Northern cities, race riots became commonplace. Northern 
whites, even many former abolitionists, began to accept the 
white South's views on race relations. 

That northern whites would resort to violence was made 
clear in anti-Negro riots in New York City, 1900; Springfield, 
Ohio, 1904; Greensburg, Ind., 1906; Springfield, 111., 1908. 

The latter was a three-day riot, initiated by a white woman's 
charge of rape by a Negro, inflamed by newspapers, inten- 
sified by crowds of whites gathered around the jail demanding 
that the Negro, arrested and imprisoned, be lynched. When 
the sheriff transferred the accused and another Negro to a jail 
in a nearby town, rioters headed for the Negro section and 
attacked homes and businesses owned by or catering to Ne- 
groes. White owners who showed handkerchiefs in their win- 
dows averted harm to their stores. One Negro was summarily 
lynched, others were dragged from houses and streetcars and 
beaten. By the time National Guardsmen could reach the 
scene, six persons were dead — four whites and two Negroes; 
property damage was extensive. Many Negroes left Spring- 
field, hoping to find better conditions elsewhere, especially in 
Chicago. 

Protest in the Early 1900's 

Between his famous Atlanta Exposition Address in 1895 
and his death in 1915, Booker T. Washington, principal of the 
Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute in Alabama and the 
most prominent Negro in America, privately spent thousands 
of dollars fighting disfranchisement and segregation laws; pub- 
licly he advocated a policy of accommodation, conciliation, 
and gradualism. Washington believed that by helping them- 
selves, by creating and supporting their own businesses, by 
proving their usefulness to society through the acquisition of 
education, wealth, and morality, Negroes would earn the re- 
spect of the white man and thus eventually gain their constitu- 
tional rights. 

Self-help and self-respect appeared a practical and sure, if 
gradual, way of ultimately achieving racial equality. Wash- 
ington's doctrines also gained support because they appealed 
to race pride — if Negroes believed in themselves, stood to- 
gether, and supported each other, they would be able to shape 
their destinies. 

In the early years of the century, a small group of Negroes, 
led by W.E.B. Du Bois, formed the Niagara Movement to 

216 


oppose Washington's program. Washington had put economic 
progress before politics, had accepted the separate-but-equal 
theory, and opposed agitation and protest. Du Bois and his fol- 
lowers stressed political activity as the basis of the Negro's 
future, insisted on the inequity of Jim Crow laws, and advo- 
cated agitation and protest. 

In sharp language, the Niagara group placed responsibility 
for the race problem squarely on the whites. The aims of the 
movement were voting rights and "the abolition of all caste 
distinctions based simply on race and color." 

Although Booker T. Washington tried to crush his critics, 
Du Bois and the Negro "radicals," as they were called, enlisted 
the support of a small group of influential white liberals and 
socialists. Together, in 1909-1910, they formed the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. 

The NAACP hammered at the walls of prejudice by organ- 
izing Negroes and well-disposed whites, by aiming propaganda 
at the whole nation, by taking legal action in courts and legis- 
latures. Almost at the outset of its career, the NAACP pre- 
vailed upon the Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional two 
discriminatory statutes. In 1915, the Court struck down the 
Oklahoma "grandfather clause," a provision in several South- 
ern state constitutions that, together with voting tests, had the 
effect of excluding from the vote those whose ancestors were 
ineligible to vote in 1860. Two years later, the Supreme Court 
outlawed residential segregation ordinances. These NAACP 
victories were the first legal steps in a long fight against dis- 
franchisement and segregation. 

During the first quarter of the 20th century, the federal 
government enacted no new legislation to ensure equal rights 
or opportunities for Negroes and made little attempt to enforce 
existing laws despite flagrant violations of Negro civil rights. 

In 1913, members of Congress from the South introduced 
bills to federalize the Southern segregation policy. They wished 
to ban interracial marriages in the District of Columbia, segre- 
gate white and Negro federal employees, and introduce Jim 
Crow laws in the public carriers of the District. The bills did 
not pass, but segregation practices were extended in federal 
offices, shops, restrooms, and lunchrooms. The nation's capital 
became as segregated as any in the former Confederate states. 

East St. Louis, 1917 

Elsewhere there was violence. In July 1917, in East St 
Louis, a riot claimed the lives of 39 Negroes and nine whites, 
as a result of fear by white working men that Negro advances 

217 


in economic, political and social status were threatening their 
own security and status. 

When the labor force of an aluminum plant went on strike, 
the company hired Negro workers. A labor union delegation 
called on the mayor and asked that further migration of 
Negroes to East St. Louis be stopped: As the men were leaving 
City Hall, they heard that a Negro had accidentally shot a 
white man during a holdup. In a few minutes rumor had re- 
placed fact: the shooting was intentional — a white woman had 
been insulted — two white girls were shot. By this time 3,000 
people had congregated and were crying for vengeance. Mobs 
roamed the streets, beating Negroes. Policemen did little more 
than take the injured to hospitals and disarm Negroes. 

The National Guard restored order. When the governor 
withdrew the troops, tensions were still high, and scattered 
episodes broke the peace. The press continued to emphasize 
the incidence of Negro crimes. White pickets and Negro work- 
ers at the aluminum company skirmished and, on July 1, some 
whites drove through the main Negro neighborhood firing 
into homes. Negro residents armed themselves. When a police 
car drove down the street Negroes riddled it with gunshot. 

The next day a Negro was shot on the main street and a 
new riot was underway. The area became a "bloody half mile" 
for three or four hours; streetcars were stopped, and Negroes, 
without regard to age or sex, were pulled off and stoned, 
clubbed and kicked, and mob leaders calmly shot and killed 
Negroes who were lying in blood in the street. As the victims 
were placed in an ambulance, the crowds cheered and ap- 
plauded. 

Other rioters set fire to Negro homes, and by midnight the 
Negro section was in flames and Negroes were fleeing the city. 
There were 48 dead, hundreds injured, and more than 300 
buildings destroyed. 

World War I and Postwar Violence 

When the United States entered World War I in 1917, the 
country again faced the question whether American citizens 
should have the right to serve, on an equal basis, in defense of 
their country. More than two million Negroes registered under 
the Selective Service Act, and some 360,000 were called into 
service. 

The Navy rejected Negroes except as menials. The Marine 
Corps rejected them altogether. The Army formed them into 

218 


separate units commanded, for the most part, by white officers. 
Only after great pressure did the Army permit Negro candi- 
dates to train as officers in a segregated camp. Mistreated 
at home and overseas, Negro combat units performed ex- 
ceptionally well under French commanders, who refused to 
heed American warnings that Negroes were inferior people. 

Negro soldiers returning home were mobbed for attempting 
to use facilities open to white soldiers. Of the 70 Negroes 
lynched during the first year after the war, a substantial num- 
ber were soldiers. Some were lynched in uniform. 

Reorganized in 1915, the Ku Klux Klan was flourishing 
again by 1919. Its program "for uniting native-born white 
Christians for concerted action in the preservation of American 
institutions and the supremacy of the white race," was imple- 
mented by flogging, branding with acid, tarring and feather- 
ing, hanging and burning. It destroyed the elemental rights of 
many Negroes, and of some whites. 

Violence took the form of lynchings and riots, and major 
riots by whites against Negroes took place in 1917 in Chester, 
Pennsylvania, and Philadelphia; in 1919 in Washington, D.C., 
Omaha, Charleston, Longview, Texas, Chicago, and Knoxville; 
in 1921 in Tulsa. 

The Chicago riot of 1919 flared from the increase in Negro 
population, which had more than, doubled in 10 years. Jobs 
were plentiful, but housing was not. Black neighborhoods ex- 
panded into white sections of the city, and trouble developed. 
Between July 1917 and March 1921, 58 Negro houses were 
bombed, and recreational areas were sites of racial conflict. 

The riot itself started on Sunday, July 27, with stone throw- 
ing and sporadic fighting at adjoining white and Negro beaches. 
A Negro boy swimming off the Negro beach drifted into water 
reserved for whites and drowned. Young Negroes claimed he 
had been struck by stones and demanded the arrest of a white 
man. Instead, police arrested a Negro. Negroes attacked police- 
men, and news spread to the city. White and Negro groups 
clashed in the streets, two persons died, and 50 were wounded. 
On Monday, Negroes coming home from work were attacked; 
later, when whites drove cars through Negro neighborhoods 
and fired weapons, Negroes retaliated. Twenty more were 
killed and hundreds wounded. On Tuesday, a handful more 
were dead, 129 injured. Rain began to fall; the mayor finally 
called in the state militia. After nearly a week of violence the 
city quieted down. 

219 


The 1920's and the New Militancy 

In the period between the two World Wars, the NAACP 
dominated the strategy of racial advancement. The NAACP 
drew its strength from large numbers of Southern Negroes 
who had migrated to Northern cities; from a small but growing 
Negro group of professionals and businessmen. It projected 
the image of the "New Negro," race-proud and self-reliant, 
believing in racial cooperation and self-help and determined 
to fight for his constitutional rights. This was reflected in the 
work of writers and artists known as the "Harlem Renais- 
sance" who drew upon the Negro's own cultural tradition and 
experience. W. E. B. DuBois, editor of the Crisis, NAACP pub- 
lication, symbolized the new mood and exerted great influence. 

The NAACP did extraordinary service, giving legal defense 
to victims of race riots and unjust judicial proceedings. It 
obtained the release of the soldiers who had received life sen- 
tences on charges of rioting against intolerable conditions at 
Houston in 1917. It successfully defended Negro sharecroppers 
in Elaine, Arkansas, who in 1919 had banded together to gain 
fairer treatment, who had become the objects of a massive 
armed hunt by whites to put them "in their place," and who 
were charged with insurrection when they resisted. It secured 
the acquittal, with the help of Clarence Darrow, of Dr. Ossian 
Sweet and his family who had moved into a white neighbor- 
hood in Detroit, shot at a mob attacking their home, killed a 
man, and were eventually judged to have committed the act in 
self-defense. 

Less successful were attempts to prevent school segregation 
in Northern cities. Gerrymandering of school boundaries and 
other devices by boards of education were fought with written 
petitions, verbal protests to school officials, legal suits and, in 
several cities, school boycotts. All proved of no avail. 

The thrust of the NAACP was primarily political and legal, 
but the National Urban League, founded in 1911 by philan- 
thropists and social workers, sought an economic solution to 
the Negroes' problems. Sympathetic with Booker T. Washing- 
ton's point of view, believing in conciliation, gradualism, and 
moral suasion, the Urban League searched out industrial op- 
portunities for Negro migrants to the cities, using arguments 
that appealed to the white businessman's sense of economic 
self-interest and also to his conscience. 

Another important figure who espoused an economic pro- 

220 


gram to ameliorate the Negroes' condition was A. Philip Ran- 
dolph, an editor of the Messenger. He regarded the NAACP as 
a middle-class organization unconcerned about pressing eco- 
nomic problems. Taking a Marxist position on the causes of 
prejudice and discrimination, Randolph called for a new and 
radical Negro unafraid to demand his rights as a member of the 
working class. He advocated physical resistance to white mobs, 
but he believed that only united action of black and white 
workers against capitalists would achieve social justice. 

Although Randolph addressed himself to the urban working 
masses, few of them ever read the Messenger. The one man 
who reached the masses of frustrated and disillusioned migrants 
in the Northern ghettos was Marcus Garvey. 

Garvey, founder in 1914 of the Universal Negro Improve- 
ment Association (UNIA), aimed to liberate both Africans 
and American Negroes from their oppressors. His Utopian 
method was the wholesale migration of American Negroes to 
Africa. Contending that whites would always be racist, he 
stressed racial pride and history, denounced integration, and 
insisted that the black man develop "a distinct racial type of 
civilization of his own and . . . work out his salvation in his 
motherland." On a more practical level he urged support of 
Negro businesses, and through the UNIA organized a chain 
of groceries, restaurants, laundries, a hotel, printing plant, and 
steamship line. When several prominent Negroes called the 
attention of the United States Government to irregularities in 
the management of the steamship line, Garvey was jailed, 
then deported for having used the mails to defraud. 

But Garvey dramatized, as no one before, the bitterness 
and alienation of the Negro slum dwellers who, having come 
North with great expectations, found only overcrowded and 
deteriorated housing, mass unemployment, and race riots. 

The Depression 

Negro labor, relatively unorganized and the target of dis- 
crimination and hostility, was hardly prepared for the de- 
pression of the 1930's. To a disproportionate extent, Negroes 
lost their jobs in cities and worked for starvation wages in 
rural areas. Although organizations like the National Urban 
League tried to improve employment opportunities, 65 percent 
of Negro employables were in need of public assistance by 
1935. 

Public assistance was given on a discriminatory basis, es- 
pecially in the South. For a time Dallas and Houston gave no 

221 


relief at all to Negro or Mexican families. In general, Negroes 
had more difficulty than whites in obtaining assistance, and the 
relief benefits were smaller. Some religious and charitable 
organizations excluded Negroes from their soup kitchens. 

The New Deal 

The New Deal marked a turning point in American race 
relations. Negroes found much in the New Deal to complain 
about: discrimination existed in many agencies; federal hous- 
ing programs expanded urban ghettos; money from the Agri- 
cultural Adjustment Administration went in the South chiefly 
to white landowners, while crop restrictions forced many Ne- 
gro sharecroppers off the land. Nevertheless, Negroes shared 
in relief, jobs, and public housing, and Negro leaders, who 
felt the open sympathy of many highly placed New Dealers, 
held more prominent political positions than at any time since 
President Taft's administration. The creation of the Congress 
of Industrial Organizations (CIO), with its avowed philosophy 
of non-discrimination, made the notion of an alliance of black 
and white workers something more than a visionary's 
dream. 

The depression, the New Deal, and the CIO reoriented 
Negro protest to concern with economic problems. Negroes 
conducted "Don't Buy Where You Can't Work" campaigns in 
a number of cities, boycotted and picketed commercial estab- 
lishments owned by whites, and sought equality in American 
society through an alliance with white labor. 

The NAACP came under attack from some Negroes. Du 
Bois resigned as editor of the Crisis in 1934 in part because he 
believed in the value of collective racial economic endeavor 
and saw little point in protesting disfranchisement and seg- 
regation without more actively pursuing economic goals. 
Younger critics also disagreed with NAACP's gradualism on 
economic issues. 

Undeterred, the NAACP broadened the scope of its legal 
work, fought a vigorous though unsuccessful campaign to 
abolish the poll tax, and finally won its attack on the white 
primaries in 1944 through the Supreme Court. But the heart 
of its litigation was a long-range campaign against segregation 
and the most obvious inequities in the Southern school sys- 
tems: the lack of professional and graduate schools and the 
low salaries received by Negro teachers. Not until about 1950 
would the NAACP make a direct assault against school segre- 

222 


gation on the legal ground that separate facilities were in- 
herently unequal. 

World War II 

During World War II, Negroes learned again that fighting 
for their country brought them no nearer to full citizenship. 
Rejected when they tried to enlist, they were accepted into the 
Army according to the proportion of the Negro population to 
that of the country as a whole — but only in separate units — 
and those mostly noncombat. The United States thus fought 
racism in Europe with a segregated fighting force. The Red 
Cross, with the government's approval, separated Negro and 
white blood in banks established for wounded servicemen — 
even though the blood banks were largely the work of a Negro 
physician, Charles Drew. 

Not until 1949 would the Armed Forces begin to adopt a 
firm policy against segregation. 

Negroes seeking employment in defense industries were 
embittered by policies like that of a West Coast aviation factory 
which declared openly that "the Negro will be considered only 
as janitors and in other similar capacities. . . . Regardless of 
their training as aircraft workers, we will not employ them." 

Two new movements marked Negro protest: the March 
on Washington, and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). 
In 1941, consciously drawing on the power of the Negro vote 
and concerned with the economic problems of the urban slum- 
dweller, A. Philip Randolph threatened a mass Negro con- 
vergence on Washington unless President Roosevelt secured 
employment for Negroes in the defense industries. The Presi- 
dent's Executive Order 8802 establishing a federal Fair Em- 
ployment Practices Commission forestalled the demonstration. 
Even without enforcement powers, the FEPC set a precedent 
for treating fair employment practice as a civil right. 

CORE, founded in 1942-43, grew out of the Fellowship of 
Reconciliation, a pacifist organization, when certain leaders 
became interested in the use of nonviolent direct action to 
fight racial discrimination. CORE combined Gandhi's tech- 
niques with the sit-in, derived from the sit-down strikes of the 
1930's. Until about 1959, CORE's main activity was attacking 
discrimination in places of public accommodation in the 
cities of the Northern and Border states, and as late as 1961, 
two-thirds of its membership and most of its national officers 
were white. 

223 


Meanwhile, wartime racial disorders had broken out sporad- 
ically— in Mobile, Los Angeles, Beaumont, Texas, and else- 
where. The riot in Detroit in 1943 was the most destructive. 
The Negro population in the city had risen sharply and more 
than 50,000 recent arrivals put immense pressures on the 
housing market. Neighborhood turnover at the edge of the 
ghetto bred bitterness and sometimes violence, and recreational 
areas became centers of racial abrasion. The federal regula- 
tions requiring employment standards in defense industries 
also angered whites, and several unauthorized walk-outs had 
occurred in automobile plants after Negro workers were up- 
graded. Activities in the city of several leading spokesmen for 
white supremacy — Gerald L. K. Smith, Frank J. Norris, and 
Father Charles Coughlin — inflamed many white southerners 
who migrated to Detroit during the war. 

On Sunday, June 20, rioting broke out on Belle Isle, a 
recreational spot used by both races, but predominantly by 
Negroes. Fist fights escalated into a major conflict. The first 
wave of looting and bloodshed began in the Negro ghetto 
"Paradise Valley" and later spread to other sections of the city. 
Whites began attacking Negroes as they emerged from the 
city's all-night movie theatres in the downtown area. White 
forays into Negro residential areas by car were met by gunfire. 
By the time federal troops arrived to halt the racial conflict, 
25 Negroes and nine whites were dead, property damage ex- 
ceeded $2 million, and a legacy of fear and hate descended 
on the city. 

In Harlem, New York, a riot erupted also in 1943, follow- 
ing the attempt of a white policeman to arrest a Negro woman 
defended by a Negro soldier. Negro rioters assaulted white 
passersby, overturned parked automobiles, tossed bricks and 
bottles at policemen, but the major emphasis was on destroy- 
ing property, looting and burning stores. Six persons died, over 
500 were injured, more than 100 were jailed. 

The Postwar Period 

White opinion in some quarters of America had begun to 
shift to a more sympathetic regard for Negroes during the 
New Deal, and the war had accelerated that movement. 
Thoughtful whites had been painfully aware of the contradic- 
tion in opposing Nazi racial philosophy with racially segregated 
military units. In the postwar years, American racial attitudes 
became more liberal as new nonwhite nations emerged in 

224 


Asia and Africa and took increasing responsibilities in inter- 
national councils. 

Against this background, the growing size of the Northern 
Negro vote made civil rights a major issue in national elec- 
tions and, ultimately, in 1957, led to the establishment of the 
federal Civil Rights Commission, which had the power to in- 
vestigate discriminatory conditions throughout the country and 
to recommend corrective measures to the President. Northern 
and Western states outlawed discrimination in employment, 
housing, and public accommodations, while the NAACP, in 
successive court victories, won judgments against racially re- 
strictive covenants in housing, segregation in interstate trans- 
portation, and discrimination in publicly-owned recreational 
facilities. The NAACP helped register voters, and in 1954, 
Brown v. Board of Education became the triumphant climax 
to the NAACP's campaign against educational segregation in 
the public schools of the South. 

CORE, which had been conducting demonstrations in the 
Border states, its major focus on public accommodations, be- 
gan experimenting with direct-action techniques to open 
employment opportunities. In 1947, in conjunction with the 
Fellowship of Reconciliation, CORE conducted a "Journey of 
Reconciliation" — what would later be called a "Freedom Ride" 
— in the states of the Upper South to test compliance with the 
Supreme Court decision outlawing segregation on interstate 
buses. The resistance met by riders in some areas, the sen- 
tencing of two of them to 30 days on a North Carolina road 
gang, dramatized the gap between American democratic theory 
and practice. 

But what captured the imagination of the nation and of the 
Negro community in particular, and what was chiefly re- 
sponsible for the growing use of direct-action techniques, was 
the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott of 1955-1956, which 
catapulted into national prominence the Reverend Martin 
Luther King, Jr. Like the founders of CORE, King held to a 
Gandhian belief in the principles of pacifism. 

Even before a court decision obtained by NAACP attorneys 
in November 1956 desegregated the Montgomery buses, a 
similar movement had started in Tallahassee, Florida. After- 
ward another one developed in Birmingham, Alabama. In 
1957, the Tuskegee Negroes undertook a three-year boycott of 
local merchants after the state legislature gerrymandered 
nearly all of the Negro voters outside of the town's boun- 
daries. In response to a lawsuit filed by the NAACP, the 

225 


Supreme  Court  ruled  the  Tuskegee  gerrymander  illegal. 

These events were widely heralded. The "new Negro" had 
emerged in the South — militant, no longer fearful of white 
hoodlums or mobs, and ready to use his collective weight to 
achieve his ends. In this mood, King established the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference in 1957 to coordinate direct- 
action activities in Southern cities. 

Nonviolent direct action attained popularity not only be- 
cause of the effectiveness of King's leadership but because the 
older techniques of legal and legislative action had had limited 
success. Impressive as the advances in the 15 years after World 
War II were, in spite of state laws and Supreme Court de- 
cisions, something was still clearly wrong. Negroes were dis- 
franchised in most of the South, though in the 12 years fol- 
lowing the outlawing of the white primary in 1944, the number 
of Negroes registered in Southern states had risen from about 
250,000 to nearly a million and a quarter. Supreme Court 
decisions desegregating transportation facilities were still being 
largely ignored in the South. Discrimination in employment 
and housing continued, not only in the South but also in 
Northern states with model civil rights laws. The Negro un- 
employment rate steadily moved upward after 1954. The 
South reacted to the Supreme Court's decision on school de- 
segregation by attempting to outlaw the NAACP, intimidating 
civil rights leaders, bringing "massive resistance" to the Court's 
decision, curtailing Negro voter registration, and forming 
White Citizens' Councils. 

Revolution of Rising Expectations 

At the same time, Negro attitudes were changing. In what 
has been described as a "revolution in expectations," Negroes 
were gaining a new sense of self-respect and a new self-image 
as a result of the civil rights movement and their own ad- 
vancement. King and others were demonstrating that non- 
violent direct action could succeed in the South. New laws 
and court decisions and increasing support of white public 
opinion gave American Negroes a new confidence in the 
future. 

Negroes no longer felt that they had to accept the humilia- 
tions of second-class citizenship. Ironically, it was the very 
successes in the legislatures and the courts that, more perhaps 
than any other single factor, led to intensified Negro expecta- 
tions and resulting dissatisfaction with the limitations of legal 
and legislative programs.  Increasing Negro impatience ac- 

226 


counted for the rising tempo of nonviolent direct action in the 
late 1950's, culminating in the student sit-ins of 1960 and the 
inauguration of what is popularly known as the "Civil Rights 
Revolution" or the "Negro Revolt." 

Many believe that the Montgomery boycott ushered in this 
Negro Revolt, and there is no doubt that, in projecting the 
image of King and his techniques, it had great importance. But 
the decisive break with traditional techniques came with the 
college student sit-ins that swept the South in the winter and 
spring of 1960. In dozens of communities in the Upper South, 
the Atlantic coastal states, and Texas, student demonstrations 
secured the desegregation of lunch counters in drug and variety 
stores. Arrests were numbered in the thousands, and brutality 
was evident in scores of communities. In the Deep South the 
campaign ended in failure, even in instances where hundreds 
had been arrested, as in Montgomery; Orangeburg, South 
Carolina; and Baton Rouge. But the youth had captured the 
imagination of the Negro community and to a remarkable 
extent of the whole nation. 

Student Involvement 

The Negro protest movement would never be the same 
again. The Southern college students shook the power struc- 
ture of the Negro community, made direct action temporarily 
pre-eminent as a civil rights tactic, speeded up the process of 
social change in race relations, and ultimately turned the 
Negro protest organizations toward a deep concern with the 
economic and social problems of the masses. 

Involved in this was a gradual shift in both tactics and 
goals: from legal to direct action, from middle and upper class 
to mass action, from attempts to guarantee the Negro's con- 
stitutional rights to efforts to secure economic policies giving 
him equality of opportunity, from appeals to the sense of 
fair play of white Americans to demands based upon power 
in the black ghetto. 

The successes of the student movement threatened existing 
Negro leadership and precipitated a spirited rivalry among civil 
rights oragnizations. The NAACP and SCLC associated them- 
selves with the student movement* The organizing meeting of 
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) at 
Raleigh, North Carolina, in April 1960 was called by Martin 
Luther King, but within a year the youth considered King too 
cautious and broke with him. 

The NAACP now decided to make direct action a major 

227 


part of its strategy and organized and reactivated college and 
youth chapters in the Southern and Border states. 

CORE, still unknown to the general public, installed James 
Farmer as national director in January 1961, and that spring 
joined the front rank of civil rights organizations with the 
famous Freedom Ride to Alabama and Mississippi that dram- 
atized the persistence of segregated public transportation. 
A bus-burning resulted in Alabama, and hundreds of demon- 
strators spent a month or more in Mississippi prisons. Finally, 
a new order from the Interstate Commerce Commission de- 
segregating all interstate transportation facilities received 
partial compliance. 

Organizational Differences 

Disagreement over strategy and tactics inevitably became 
intertwined with personal and organizational rivalries. Each 
civil rights group felt the need for proper credit in order to 
obtain the prestige and financial contributions necessary to 
maintain and expand its own programs. The local and na- 
tional, individual and organizational clashes only stimulated 
competition and activity that further accelerated the pace of 
social change. 

Yet there were differences in style. CORE was the most in- 
terracial. SCLC appeared to be the most deliberate. SNCC staff 
workers lived on subsistence allowances and seemed to regard 
going to jail as a way of life. The NAACP continued the most 
varied programs, retaining a strong emphasis on court litiga- 
tion, maintaining a highly effective lobby at the national 
capital, and engaging in direct-action campaigns. The National 
Urban League, under the leadership of Whitney M. Young, 
Jr., appointed executive director in 1961, became more out- 
spoken and talked more firmly to businessmen who had pre- 
viously been treated with utmost tact and caution. 

The role of whites in the protest movement gradually 
changed. Instead of occupying positions of leadership, they 
found themselves relegated to the role of followers. Whites 
were likely to be suspect in the activist organizations. Negroes 
had come to feel less dependent on whites, more confident of 
their own power, and they demanded that their leaders be 
black. The NAACP had long since acquired Negro leadership 
but continued to welcome white liberal support. SCLC and 
SNCC were from the start Negro-led and Negro-dominated. 
CORE became predominantly Negro as it expanded in 1962 

228 


and 1963; today all executives are Negro, and a constitutional 
amendment adopted in 1965 officially limited white leader- 
ship in the chapters. 

A major factor intensifying the civil rights movement was 
widespread Negro unemployment and poverty; an important 
force in awakening Negro protest was the meteoric rise to 
national prominence of the Black Muslims, established around 
1930. The organization reached the peak of its influence when 
more progress toward equal rights was being made than ever 
before in American history, while at the same time the poorest 
groups in the urban ghettos were stagnating. 

The Black Muslims preached a vision of the doom of 
the white "devils" and the coming dominance of the black 
man, promised a Utopian paradise of a separate territory 
within the United States for a Negro state, and offered a prac- 
tical program of building Negro business through hard work, 
thrift, and racial unity. To those willing to submit to the rigid 
discipline of the movement, the Black Muslims organization 
gave a sense of purpose and dignity. 

"Freedom Now!" and Civil Rights Laws 

As the direct-action tactics took more dramatic form, as the 
civil rights groups began to articulate the needs of the masses 
and draw some of them to their demonstrations, the protest 
movement in 1963 assumed a new note of urgency, a demand 
for complete "Freedom Now!" Direct action returned to the 
Northern cities, taking the form of massive protests against 
economic, housing and educational inequities, and a fresh 
wave of demonstrations swept the South from Cambridge, 
Maryland, to Birmingham, Alabama. Northern Negroes 
launched street demonstrations against discrimination in the 
building trade unions and, the following winter, school boy- 
cotts against de facto segregation. 

In the North, 1963 and 1964 brought the beginning of the 
waves of civil disorders in Northern urban centers. In the 
South, incidents occurred of brutal white resistance to the 
civil rights movement, beginning with the murders of Missis- 
sippi Negro leader Medgar Evers and four Negro schoolgirls 
in a church in Birmingham. These disorders and the events in 
the South are detailed in the introduction to Chapter 1, the 
Profiles of Disorder. 

The massive anti-Negro resistance in Birmingham and nu- 
merous other Southern cities during the spring of 1963, com- 

229 


pelled the nation to face the problem of race prejudice in the 
South. President Kennedy affirmed that racial discrimination 
was a moral issue and asked Congress for a major civil rights 
bill. But a major impetus for what was to be the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964 was the March on Washington in August 1963. 

Early in the year, A. Philip Randolph issued a call for a 
March on Washington to dramatize the need for jobs and to 
press for a federal commitment to job action. At about the 
same time, Protestant, Jewish, and Catholic churches sought 
and obtained representation on the March committee. Al- 
though the AFL-CIO national council refused to endorse the 
March, a number of labor leaders and international unions 
participated. 

Reversing an earlier stand, President Kennedy approved 
the March. A quarter of a million people, about 20 percent 
of them white, participated. It was more than a summation 
of the past years of struggle and aspiration. It symbolized 
certain new directions: a deeper concern for the economic 
problems of the masses; more involvement of white moderates; 
and new demands from the most militant, who implied that 
only a revolutionary change in American institutions would 
permit Negroes to achieve the dignity of citizens. 

President Kennedy had set the stage for the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964. After his death President Johnson took forceful 
and effective action to secure its enactment. The law settled 
the public accommodations issue in the South's major cities. 
Its voting section, however, promised more than it could ac- 
complish. Martin Luther King and SCLC dramatized the issue 
locally with demonstrations at Selma, Alabama, in the spring 
of 1965. Again the national government was forced to inter- 
vene, and a new and more effective voting law was passed. 

Failures of Direct Action 

Birmingham had made direct action respectable, but Selma, 
which drew thousands of white moderates from the North, 
made direct action fashionable. Yet as early as 1964, it was 
becoming evident that, like legal action, direct action was of 
limited usefulness. 

In deep South states like Mississippi and Alabama, direct 
action had failed to desegregate public accommodations in 
the sit-ins of 1960-1961. A major reason was that Negroes 
lacked the leverage of the vote. The demonstrations of the 
early 1960's had been successful principally in places like At- 

230 


lanta, Nashville, Durham, Winston-Salem, Louisville, Savan- 
nah, New Orleans, Charleston, and Dallas — where Negroes 
voted and could swing elections. Beginning in 1961 Robert 
Moses of SNCC, with the cooperation of CORE and NAACP, 
established voter registration projects in the cities and county 
seats of Mississippi. He succeeded in registering only a hand- 
ful of Negroes, but by 1964, he had generated Enough support 
throughout the country to enable the Mississippi Freedom 
Democratic Party, which he had created, to challenge dramat- 
ically the seating of the official white delegates from the state 
at the Democratic National Convention. 

In the black ghettos of the North direct action also largely 
failed. Street demonstrations did compel employers, from 
supermarkets to banks, to add Negroes to their work force in 
Northern and Western cities, and even in some Southern cities 
where the Negroes had considerable buying power. However, 
separate and inferior schools, slum housing,. and police hostility 
proved invulnerable to direct attack. 

New Directions 

But while Negroes were being hired in increasing numbers, 
mass unemployment and underemployment remained. As 
economist Vivian Henderson pointed out in his testimony be- 
fore the Commission: 

No one can deny that all Negroes have benefited from civil 
rights laws and desegregation in public life in one way or another. 
The fact is, however, that the masses of Negroes have not ex- 
perienced tangible benefits in a significant way. This is so in 
education and housing. It is critically so in the area of jobs and 
economic security. Expectations of Negro masses for equal job 
opportunity programs have fallen far short of fulfillment. 

Negroes have made gains. . . . There have been important 
gains. But ... the masses of Negroes have been virtually un- 
touched by those gains* 

Faced with the intransigence of the deep South and the 
inadequacy of direct action to solve the problems of the slum 
dwellers, Negro protest organizations began to diverge. The 
momentum toward unity, apparent in 1963, was lost. At the 
very time that white support for the protest movement was 
rising markedly, militant Negroes felt increasingly isolated 
from the American scene. On two things, however, all seg- 
ments of the protest movement agreed: (1) future civil rights 

231 


activity would have to focus on the economic and social dis- 
crimination in the urban ghettos and (2) while demonstrations 
would still have a place, the major weapon would have to be 
the political potential of the black masses. 

By the middle of the decade, many militant Negro mem- 
bers of SNCC and CORE began to turn away from American 
society and the "middle-class way of life." Cynical about the 
liberals and the leaders of organized labor, they regarded com- 
promise, even as a temporary tactical device, as anathema. 
They talked more of "revolutionary" changes in the social 
structure, of retaliatory violence, and increasingly rejected 
white assistance. They insisted that Negro power alone could 
compel the white "ruling class" to make concessions. Yet they 
also spoke of an alliance of Negroes and unorganized lower- 
class whites to overthrow the "power structure" of capitalists, 
politicians and bureaucratic labor leaders who exploited the 
poor of both races by dividing them through an appeal to race 
prejudice. 

At the same time that their activities declined, other issues, 
particularly Vietnam, diverted the attention of the country, 
including some Negro leaders, from the issue of equality. In 
civil rights organizations, reduced financing made it increas- 
ingly difficult to support staff personnel. Most important was 
the increasing frustration of expectations that affected the 
direct-action advocates of the early 1960's — the sense of fu- 
tility growing out of the feeling that progress had turned out to 
be "tokenism," that the compromises of the white community 
were sedatives rather than solutions and that the current meth- 
ods of Negro protest were doing little for the masses of the 
race. 

As frustration grew, the ideology and rhetoric of a number 
of civil rights activists became angrier. One man more than 
any other — a black man who grew up believing whites had 
murdered his father — became the spokesman for this anger: 
Malcolm X, who perhaps best embodied the belief that racism 
was so deeply ingrained in white America that appeals to con- 
science would bring no fundamental change. 

"Black Power" 

In this setting the rhetoric of "Black Power" developed. 
The precipitating occasion was the Meredith March from 
Memphis to Jackson in June 1966, but the slogan expressed 
tendencies that had been present for a long time and had been 
gaining strength in the Negro community. 

232 


Black Power first articulated a mood rather than a program 
— disillusionment and alienation from white America and in- 
dependence, race pride, and self-respect, or "black conscious- 
ness." Having become a household phrase, the term generated 
intense discussion of its real meaning, and a broad spectrum pi 
ideologies and programmatic proposals emerged. 

In politics, Black Power meant independent -action — Negro 
control of the political power of the black ghettos and its 
use to improve economic and social conditions. It could take 
the form of organizing a black political party or controlling the 
political machinery within the ghetto without the guidance or 
support of white politicians. Where predominantly Negro areas 
lacked Negroes in elective office, whether in the rural Black 
Belt of the South or in the urban centers, Black Power advo- 
cates sought the election of Negroes by voter registration 
campaigns, by getting out the vote, and by working for re- 
drawing electoral districts. The basic belief was that only a 
well-organized and cohesive bloc of Negro voters could provide 
for the needs of the black masses. Even some Negro politicians 
allied to the major political parties adopted the term "Black 
Power" to describe their interest in the Negro vote. 

In economic terms, Black Power meant creating independ- 
ent, self-sufficient Negro business enterprise, not only by en- 
couraging Negro entrepreneurs but also by forming Negro 
cooperatives in the ghettos and in the predominantly black 
rural counties of the South. In the area of education, Black 
Power called for local community control of the public schools 
in the black ghettos. 

Throughout, the emphasis was on self-help, racial unity, 
and, among the most militant, retaliatory violence, the latter 
ranging from the legal right of self-defense to attempts to 
justify looting and arson in ghetto riots, guerrilla warfare and 
armed rebellion. 

Phrases like "Black Power," "Black Consciousness," and 
"Black is Beautiful," enjoyed an extensive currency in the 
Negro community, even within the NAACP and among rela- 
tively conservative politicians, but particularly among young 
intellectuals and Afro-American student groups on predomi- 
nantly white college campuses. Expressed in its most extreme 
form by small, often local, fringe groups, the Black Power 
ideology became associated with SNCC and CORE. 

Generally regarded as the most militant among the impor- 
tant Negro protest organizations, they have developed different 
interpretations of the Black Power doctrine. SNCC calls for 
totally independent political action outside the established po- 

233 


litical parties, as with the Black Panther Party in Lowndes 
County, Ala.; rejects political alliances with other groups until 
Negroes have themselves built a substantial base of independ- 
ent political power; applauds the idea of guerrilla warfare; 
and regards riots as rebellions. 

CORE has been more flexible. Approving the SNCC 
strategy, it also advocates working within the Democratic 
Party; forming alliances with other groups and, while seeking 
to justify riots as the natural explosion of an oppressed people 
against intolerable conditions, advocates violence only in self- 
defense. Both groups favor cooperatives, but CORE has 
seemed more inclined toward job-training programs and de- 
veloping a Negro entrepreneurial class, based upon the market 
within the black ghettos. 

Old Wine In New Bottles 

What is new about "Black Power" is phraseology rather 
than substance. Black Consciousness has roots in the organiza- 
tion of Negro churches and mutual benefit societies in the early 
days of the republic, the antebellum Negro convention move- 
ment, the Negro colonization schemes of the 19th century, Du 
Bois' concept of Pan-Africanism, Booker T. Washington's 
advocacy of race pride, self-help, and racial solidarity, the 
Harlem Renaissance, and the Garvey movement. The decade 
after World War I — which saw the militant, race-proud "new 
Negro," the relatively widespread theory of retaliatory vio- 
lence, and the high tide of the Negro-support-of-Negro-busi- 
ness ideology — exhibits striking parallels with the 1960's. 

The theme of retaliatory violence is hardly new for Amer- 
ican Negroes. Most racial disorders in American history until 
recent years, were characterized by white attacks on Negroes. 
But Negroes retaliated violently in the past. 

Black Power rhetoric and ideology actually express a lack 
of power. The slogan emerged when the Negro protest move- 
ment was slowing down, when it was finding increasing resist- 
ance to its changing goals, when it discovered that nonviolent 
direct action was no more a panacea than legal action, when 
CORE and SNCC were declining in terms of activity, mem- 
bership, and financial support. This combination of circum- 
stances provoked anger deepened by impotence. Powerless to 
make any fundamental changes in the life of the masses — 
powerless, that is, to compel white America to make those 
changes — many advocates of Black Power have retreated into 
an unreal world, where they see an outnumbered and poverty- 
stricken minority  organizing  itself  separately  from  whites 

234 


and creating sufficient power to force white America to grant 
its demands. To date, the evidence suggests that the situation 
is much like that of the 1840's, when a small group of intel- 
lectuals advocated slave insurrections, but stopped short of 
organizing them. 

The Black Power advocates of today consciously feel that 
they are the most militant group in the Negro protest move- 
ment. Yet they have retreated from a direct confrontation with 
American society on the issue of integration and, by preaching 
separatism, unconsciously function as an accommodation to 
white racism. Much of their economic program, as well as 
their interest in Negro history, self-help, racial solidarity and 
separation, is reminiscent of Booker T. Washington. The rhet- 
oric is different, but the ideas are remarkably similar. 

The Meaning 

By 1967, whites could point to the demise of slavery, the 
decline of illiteracy among Negroes, the legal protection pro- 
vided by the constitutional amendments and civil rights legisla- 
tion, and the growing size of the Negro middle class. Whites 
would call it Negro progress from slavery to freedom toward 
equality. 

Negroes could point to the doctrine of white supremacy, its 
widespread acceptance, its persistence after emancipation, and 
its influence on the definition of the place of Negroes in Amer- 
ican life. They could point to their long fight for full citizen- 
ship, when they had active opposition from most of the white 
population and little or no support from the government. They 
could see progress toward equality accompanied by bitter re- 
sistance. Perhaps most of all, they could feel the persistent, 
pervasive racism that kept them in inferior segregated schools, 
restricted them to ghettos, barred them from fair employment, 
provided double standards in courts of justice, inflicted bodily 
harm on their children, and blighted their lives with a sense of 
hopelessness and despair. 

In all of this and in the context of professed ideals, Negroes 
would find more retrogression than progress, more rejection 
than acceptance. 

Until the middle of the 20th century, the course of Negro 
protest movements in the United States, except for slave re- 
volts, was based in the cities of the North, where Negroes 
enjoyed sufficient freedom to mount a sustained protest. It was 
in the cities, North and South, that Negroes had their greatest 
independence and mobility. It was natural, therefore, for black 
protest movements to be urban-based — and, until the last 

235 


dozen years or so, limited to the North. As Negroes migrated 
from the South, the mounting strength of their votes in North- 
ern cities became a vital element in drawing the federal gov- 
ernment into the defense of the civil rights of Southern Ne- 
groes. White rural Negroes today face great racial problems, 
the major unsolved questions that touch the core of Negro life 
stem from discrimination embedded in urban housing, employ- 
ment, and education. 

Over the years the character of Negro protest has changed. 
Originally it was a white liberal and Negro upper class move- 
ment aimed at securing the constitutional rights of Negroes 
through propaganda, lawsuits, and legislation. In recent years 
the emphasis in tactics shifted first to direct action and then — 
among the most militant — to the rhetoric of "Black Power." 
The role of white liberals declined as Negroes came to direct 
the struggle. At the same time the Negro protest movement 
became more of a mass movement, with increasing participa- 
tion from the working classes. As these changes were oc- 
curring, and while substantial progress was being made to 
secure constitutional rights for the Negroes, the goals of the 
movement were broadened. Protest groups now demand 
special efforts to overcome the Negro's poverty and cultural 
deprivation — conditions that cannot be erased simply by ensur- 
ing constitutional rights. 

The central thrust of Negro protest in the current period has 
aimed at the inclusion of Negroes in American society on a 
basis of full equality rather than at a fundamental transforma- 
tion of American institutions. There have been elements calling 
for a revolutionary overthrow of the American social system 
or for a complete withdrawal of Negroes from American so- 
ciety. But these solutions have had little popular support. Negro 
protest, for the most part, has been firmly rooted in the basic 
values of American society, seeking not their destruction but 
their fulfillment. 


Chapter 6 / The Formation of the 
Racial Ghettos 

Major Trends in Negro Population 

Throughout the 20th century, and particularly in the last 
three decades, the Negro population of the United States has 
been steadily moving from rural areas to urban, from South 
to North and West 

In 1910, 2.7 million Negroes lived in American cities — 
28 percent of the nation's Negro population of 9.8 million. 

236 


Today, about 15 million Negro Americans live in metropolitan 
areas, or 69 percent of the Negro population of 21.5 million. 
In 1910, 885,000 Negroes — 9 percent— lived outside the South. 
Now, almost 10 million, about 45 percent, live in the North 
or West. 

These shifts in population have resulted from three basic 
trends: 

• A rapid increase in the size of the Negro population. 

• A continuous flow of Negroes from Southern rural areas, partly 
to large cities in the South, but primarly to large cities in the 
North and West. 

• An increasing concentration of Negroes in large metropolitan 
areas within racially segregated neighborhoods* 

Taken together, these trends have produced large and con- 
stantly growing concentrations of Negro population within 
big cities in all parts of the nation. Because most major civil 
disorders of recent years occurred in predominantly Negro 
neighborhoods, we have examined the causes of this concen- 
tration. 

The Growth Rate of the Negro Population 

During the first half of this century, the white population 
of the United States grew at a slightly faster rate than the 
Negro population. Because fertility rates1 among Negro women 
were more than offset by death rates among Negroes and by 
large-scale immigration of whites from Europe, the proportion 
of Negroes in the country declined from 12 percent in 1900 
to 10 percent in 1940. 

By the end of World War II — and increasingly since then — 
major advances in medicine and medical care, together with 
the increasing youth of the Negro population resulting from 
higher fertility rates, caused death rates among Negroes to fall 
much faster than among whites. This is shown in the following 
table:

In addition, white immigration from outside the United States 
dropped dramatically after stringent restrictions were adopted 
in the 1920's. 

1 The "fertility rate" is the number of live births per year per 1,000 women 
age 15 to 44 in the group concerned.

Twenty-Year Period Total Immigration (millions) 
1901-1920 14.5 

1921-1940 4.6 

1941-1960 8.6 

Thus, by mid-century, both factors which previously had offset 
higher fertility rates among Negro women no longer were in 
effect. 

While Negro fertility rates, after rising rapidly to 1957, 
have declined sharply in the past decade, white fertility rates 
have dropped even more, leaving Negro rates much higher in 
comparison.

91.4               133.9 

1.46 

The result is that Negro population is now growing sig- 
nificantly faster than white population. From 1940 to 1960, the 
white population rose 34.0 percent, but the Negro population 
rose 46.6 percent. From 1960 to 1966, the white population 
grew 7.6 percent; whereas Negro population jumped 14.4 per- 
cent, almost twice as much. 

Consequently, the proportion of Negroes in the total popu- 
lation has risen from 10.0 percent in 1950 to 10.5 percent in 
1960, and 11.1 percent in 1966.2 

In 1950, at least one of every ten Americans was Negro; 
in 1966, one of nine. If this trend continues, one of every eight 
Americans will be Negro by 1972. 

Another consequence of higher birth rates among Negroes 
is that the Negro population is considerably younger than the 
white population. In 1966, the median age among whites was 
29.1 years, as compared to 21.1 among Negroes. About 35 
percent of the white population was under 18 years of age, 
compared with 45 percent for Negroes. About one of every 
six children under five and one of every six new babies are 
Negro. 

Negro-white fertility rates bear an interesting relationship 
to educational experience. Negro women with low levels of 
education have more children than white women with similar 
schooling, while Negro women with four years or more of 
college education have fewer children than white women 
similarly educated. The following table illustrates this: 

2 These proportions are undoubtedly too low because the Census Bureau 
has consistently undercounted the number of Negroes in the U. S. by as much 
as 10 percent. 

238

Four years of high school 2.3 ► 2.3

This suggests that the difference between Negro and white 
fertility rates may decline in the future if Negro educational 
attainment compares more closely with that of whites, and if 
a rising proportion of members of both groups complete 
college. 

The Migration of Negroes from the South 

The Magnitude of This Migration 

In 1910, 91 percent of the nation's 9.8 million Negroes lived 
in the South. Twenty-seven percent of American Negroes lived 
in cities of 2,500 persons or more, as compared to 49 percent 
of the nation's white population. 

By 1966, the Negro population had increased to 21.5 mil- 
lion, and two significant geographic shifts had taken place. 
The proportion of Negroes living in the South had dropped 
to 55 percent and about 69 percent of all Negroes lived in 
metropolitan areas compared to 64 percent for whites. While 
the total Negro population more than doubled from 1910 to 
1966, the number living in cities rose five-fold (from 2.7 mil- 
lion to 14.8 million) and the number outside the South rose 
eleven-fold (from 885,000 to 9.7 million). 

Negro migration from the South began after the Civil War. 
By the turn of the century, sizeable Negro populations lived 
in many large Northern cities — Philadelphia, for example, had 
63,400 Negro residents in 1900. The movement of Negroes 
out of the rural South accelerated during World War I, when 
floods and boll weevils hurt farming in the South, and the in- 
dustrial demands of the war created thousands of new jobs 
for unskilled workers in the Nofth. After the war, the shift to 
mechanized farming spurred the continuing movement of Ne- 
groes from rural Southern areas. 

The Depression slowed this migratory flow, but World War 
II set it in motion again. More recently, continuing mechaniza- 
tion of agriculture and the expansion of industrial employment

to 1966. 

Important Characteristics of this Migration 

It is useful to recall that even the latest scale of Negro migra- 
tion is relatively small when compared to the earlier waves of 
European immigrants. A total of 8.8 million immigrants en- 
tered the United States between 1901 and 1911, and another 
5.7 million arrived during the following decade. Even during 
the years from 1960 through 1966, the 1.8 million immigrants 
from abroad were almost three times the 613,000 Negroes who 
departed the South. In these same six years, California alone 
gained over 1.5 million new residents from internal shifts of 
American population. 

Three major routes of Negro migration from the South have 
developed. One runs north along the Atlantic Seaboard toward 
Boston, another north from Mississippi toward Chicago, and 
the third west from Texas and Louisiana toward California. 
Between 1955 and 1960, 50 percent of the nonwhite migrants 
to the New York metropolitan area came from North Carolina, 
South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, and Alabama; North 
Carolina alone supplied 20 percent of all New York's non- 
white immigrants. During the same period, almost 60 percent 
of the nonwhite migrants to Chicago came from Mississippi, 
Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana; Mississippi ac- 
counted for almost one-third. During these years, three-fourths 
of the nonwhite migrants to Los Angeles came from Texas, 
Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Alabama. 

The flow of Negroes from the South has caused the Negro 
population to grow more rapidly in the North and West, as 
indicated below.

As a result, although a much higher proportion of Negroes 
still reside in the South, the distribution of Negroes throughout 
the United States is beginning to approximate that of whites, as 
the following tables show.

Negroes in the North and West are now so numerous that 
natural increase rather than migration provides the greater 
part of Negro population gains there. And even though Negro 
migration has continued at a high level, it comprises a con- 
stantly declining proportion of Negro growth in these regions.

1950-1960 53.1%

In other words, we have reached the point where the Negro 
populations of the North and West will continue to expand 
significantly even if migration from the South drops sub- 
stantially.

Future Migration 

Despite accelerating Negro migration from the South, the 
Negro population there has continued to rise.

1940 99 

1950 10'.2 821,000 82,100 

1960 11.8 1,086,000 108,600 

1966 11.8 517,000 86,200 

Nor is it likely to halt. Negro birth rates in the South, as else- 
where, have fallen sharply since 1957, but so far, this decline 
has been offset by the rising Negro population base remain- 
ing in the South. From 1950 to 1960, Southern Negro births 
generated an average net increase of 254,000 per year, and 
from 1960 to 1966, an almost identical 188,000 per year. 
Even if Negro birth rates continue to fall, they are likely to 
remain high enough to support significant migration to other 
regions for some time to come. 

The Negro population in the South is becoming increas- 
ingly urbanized. In 1950, there were 5.4 million Southern 
rural Negroes; by 1960, 4.8 million. But this decline has been 
more than offset by increases in the urban population. A rising 
proportion of inter-regional migration now consists of per- 
sons moving from one city to another. From 1960 to 1966, 
rural Negro population in the South was far below its peak, 
but the annual average migration of Negroes from the South 
was still substantial. 

These facts demonstrate that Negro migration from the 
South, which has maintained a high rate for the past 
60 years, will continue, unless economic conditions change 
dramatically in either the South or the North and West. This 
conclusion is reinforced by the fact that most Southern states 
in recent decades have also experienced outflows of white 
population. From 1950 to 1960, 11 of the 17 Southern states 
(including the District of Columbia) "exported" white popula- 
tion— as compared to 13 which "exported" Negro population. 
Excluding Florida's net gain by migration of 1.5 million, the 
other 16 Southern states together had a net loss by migration 
of 1.46 million whites. 

The Concentration of Negro Population in Large Cities 

Where Negro Urbanization Has Occurred 

Statistically, the Negro population in America has become 
more urbanized, and more metropolitan, than the white popu- 

242 


lation. According to Census Bureau estimates, almost 70 per- 
cent of all Negroes in 1966 lived in metropolitan areas, com- 
pared to 64 percent of all whites. In the South, more than 
half the Negro population now lives in cities. Rural Negroes 
outnumber urban Negroes in only four states: Arkansas, 
Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. 

Basic data concerning Negro urbanization trends, presented 
in tables at the conclusion of this chapter, indicate that: 

• Almost all Negro population growth is occurring within metro- 
politan areas, primarily within central cities. From 1950 to 
1966, the U. S. Negro population rose 6.5 million. Over 98 per- 
cent of that increase took place in metropolitan areas — 86 per- 
cent within central cities, 12 percent in the urban fringe. 

• The vast majority of white population growth is occurring in 
suburban portions of metropolitan areas. From 1950 to 1966, 
77.8 percent of the white population increase of 35.6 million 
took place in the suburbs. Central cities received only 2.5 percent 
of this total white increase. Since 1960, white central-city 
population has actually declined by 1.3 million. 

• As a result, central cities are steadily becoming more heavily 
Negro, while the urban fringes around them remain almost en- 
tirely white. The proportion of Negroes in all central cities 
rose steadily from 12 percent in 1950, to 17 percent in 1960, 
to 20 percent in 1966. Meanwhile, metropolitan areas outside 
of central cities remained 95 percent white from 1950 to 1960, 
and became 96 percent white by 1966. 

• The Negro population is growing faster, both absolutely and 
relatively, in the larger metropolitan areas than in the smaller 
ones. From 1950 to 1966, the proportion of nonwhites in the 
central cities of metropolitan areas with one million or more 
persons doubled, reaching 26 percent, as compared with 20 per- 
cent in the central cities of metropolitan areas containing from 
250,000 to one million persons, and 12 percent in the central 
cities of metropolitan areas containing under 250,000 persons. 

• The 12 largest central cities (New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, 
Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, Houston, Cleveland, Washing- 
ton, D. C, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and San Francisco) now con- 
tain over two-thirds of the Negro population outside the South, 
and one-third of the total in the United States. All these 
cities have experienced rapid increases in Negro population 
since 1950. In six (Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, Mil- 
waukee, and San Francisco), the proportion of Negroes at least 
doubled. In two others (New York and Los Angeles), it prob- 
ably doubled. In 1968, seven of these cities are over 30 percent 
Negro, and one (Washington, D. C.) is two-thirds Negro. 

Factors Causing Residential Segregation 
in Metropolitan Areas 

The early pattern of Negro settlement within each metro- 
politan area followed that of immigrant groups. Migrants con- 

243 


verged on the older sections of the central city because the 
lowest cost housing was there, friends and relatives were likely 
to be there; and the older neighborhoods then often had good 
public transportation. 

But the later phases of Negro settlement and expansion in 
metropolitan areas diverge sharply from those typical of white 
immigrants. As the whites were absorbed by the larger society, 
many left their predominantly ethnic neighborhoods and moved 
to outlying areas to obtain newer housing and better schools. 
Some scattered randomly over the suburban area. Others estab- 
lished new ethnic clusters in the suburbs, but even these rarely 
contained solely members of a single ethnic group. As a result, 
most middle-class neighborhoods — both in the suburbs and 
within central cities — have no distinctive ethnic character, ex- 
cept that they are white. 

Nowhere has the expansion of America's urban Negro 
population followed this pattern of dispersal. Thousands of 
Negro families have attained incomes, living standards, and 
cultural levels matching or surpassing those of whites who 
have "upgraded" themselves from distinctly ethnic neighbor- 
hoods. Yet most Negro families have remained within pre- 
dominantly Negro neighborhoods, primarily because they have 
been effectively excluded from white residential areas. 

Their exclusion has been accomplished through various dis- 
criminatory practices, some obvious and overt, others subtle 
and hidden. Deliberate efforts are sometimes made to discour- 
age Negro families from purchasing or renting homes in all- 
white neighborhoods. Intimidation and threats of violence have 
ranged from throwing garbage on lawns and making threaten- 
ing phone calls to burning crosses in yards and even dyna- 
miting property. More often, real estate agents simply refuse 
to show homes to Negro buyers. 

Many middle-class Negro families, therefore, cease look- 
ing for homes beyond all-Negro areas or nearby "changing" 
neighborhoods. For them, trying to move into all-white neigh- 
borhoods is not worth the psychological efforts and costs 
required. 

Another form of discrimination just as significant is white 
withdrawal from, or refusal to enter, neighborhoods where 
large numbers of Negroes are moving or already residing. 
Normal population turnover causes about 20 percent of the 
residents of average United States neighborhoods to move 
out every year because of income changes, job transfers, 
shifts in life-cycle position or deaths. This normal turnover 
rate is even higher in apartment areas. The refusal of whites 
to move into changing areas when vacancies occur there 

244 


from normal turnover means that most of these vacancies are 
eventually occupied by Negroes. An inexorable shift toward 
heavy Negro occupancy results. 

Once this happens, the remaining whites seek to leave, thus 
confirming the existing belief among whites that complete 
transformation of a neighborhood is inevitable once Negroes 
begin to enter. Since the belief itself is one of the major causes 
of the transformation, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, 
which inhibits the development of racially integrated neigh- 
borhoods. 

Thus, Negro settlements expand almost entirely through 
"massive racial transition" at the edges of existing all-Negro 
neighborhoods, rather than by a gradual dispersion of popula- 
tion throughout the metropolitan area. 

Two points are particularly important: 

• "Massive transition" requires no panic or flight by the original 
white residents of a neighborhood into which Negroes begin 
moving. All it requires is the failure or refusal of other whites 
to fill the vacancies resulting from normal turnover. 

• Thus, efforts to stop massive transition by persuading present 
white residents to remain will ultimately fail unless whites out- 
side the neighborhood can be persuaded to move in. 

It is obviously true that some residential separation of whites 
and Negroes would occur even without discriminatory prac- 
tices by whites. This would result from the desires of some 
Negroes to live in predominantly Negro neighborhoods and 
from differences in meaningful social variables, such as income 
and educational levels. But these factors alone would not lead 
to the almost complete segregation of whites and Negroes 
which has developed in our metropolitan areas. 

The Exodus of Whites from Central Cities 

The process of racial transition in central-city neighbor- 
hoods has been only one factor among many others causing 
millions of whites to move out of central cities as the Negro 
populations there expanded. More basic perhaps have been 
the rising mobility and affluence of middle-class families and 
the more attractive living conditions — particularly better 
schools — in the suburbs. 

Whatever the reason, the result is clear. In 1950, 45.5 mil- 
lion whites lived in central cities. If this population had grown 
from 1950 to 1960 at the same rate as the nation's white 
population as a whole, it would have increased by eight mil- 

245 


lion. It actually rose only 2.2 million, indicating an outflow 
of 5.8 million.4 

From 1960 to 1966, the white outflow appears to have 
been even more rapid. White population of central cities de- 
clined 1.3 million instead of rising 3.6 million as it would if 
it had grown at the same rate as the entire white population. 
In theory, therefore, 4.9 million whites left central cities dur- 
ing these six years. 

Statistics for all central cities as a group understate the re- 
lationship between Negro population growth and white out- 
flow in individual central cities. The fact is, many cities with 
relatively few Negroes experienced rapid white-population 
growth, thereby obscuring the size of white out-migration that 
took place in cities having large increases in Negro popula- 
tion. For example, from 1950 to 1960, the 10 largest cities 
in the United States had a total Negro population increase of 
1.6 million, or 55 percent, while the white population there 
declined 1.4 million. If we remove the two cities where the 
white population increased (Los Angeles and Houston), the 
nonwhite population in the remaining eight rose 1.4 million; 
whereas their white population declined 2.1 million. If the 
white population in these cities had increased at only half the 
rate of the white population in the United States as a whole 
from 1950 to 1960, it would have risen by 1.4 million. Thus, 
these eight cities actually experienced a white out-migration 
of at least 3.5 million, while gaining 1.4 million nonwhites. 

The Extent of Residential Segregation 

The rapid expansion of all-Negro residential areas and 
large-scale white withdrawal have continued a pattern of resi- 
dential segregation that has existed in American cities for 
decades. A recent study5 reveals that this pattern is present to 
a high degree in every large city in America. The authors 
devised an index to measure the degree of residential segrega- 
tion. The index indicates for each city the percentage of Ne- 
groes who would have to move from the blocks where they 
now live to other blocks in order to provide a perfectly pro- 
portional, unsegregated distribution of population. 

According to their findings, the average segregation index 

* The outflow of whites may be somewhat smaller than the 5.8 million differ- 
ence between these figures, because the ages of the whites in many central 
cities are higher than in the nation as a whole, and therefore the population 
would have grown somewhat more slowly. 

* Negroes in Cities, Karl and Alma Taeuber, Aldine Publishing Co., Chi- 
cago (1965). 

246 


for 207 of the largest United States cities was 86.2 in 1960. 
This means that an average of over 86 percent of all Negroes 
would have had to change blocks to create an unsegregated 
population distribution. Southern cities had a higher average 
index (90.9) than cities in the Northeast (79.2), the North 
Central (87.7), or the West (79.3). Only eight cities had 
index values below 70, whereas over 50 had values above 91.7. 

The degree of residential segregation for all 207 cities has 
been relatively stable, averaging 85.2 in 1940, 87.3 in 1950, 
and 86.2 in 1960. Variations within individual regions were 
only slightly larger. However, a recent Census Bureau study 
shows that in most of the 12 large cities where special cen- 
suses were taken in the mid-1 960's, the proportions of Ne- 
groes living in neighborhoods of greatest Negro concentration 
had increased since 1960. 

Residential segregation is generally more prevalent with 
respect to Negroes than for any other minority group, in- 
cluding Puerto Ricans, Orientals, and Mexican Americans. 
Moreover, it varies little between central city and suburb. This 
nearly universal pattern cannot be explained in terms of eco- 
nomic discrimination against all low-income groups. Analysis 
of 15 representative cities indicates that white upper- and mid- 
dle-income households are far more segregated from Negro 
upper- and middle-income households than from white lower- 
income households. 

In summary, the concentration of Negroes in central cities 
results from a combination of forces. Some of these forces, 
such as migration and initial settlement patterns in older neigh- 
borhoods, are similar to those which affected previous ethnic 
minorities. Others — particularly discrimination in employment 
and segregation in housing and schools — are a result of white 
attitudes based on race and color. These forces continue to 
shape the future of the central city.

Chapter 7 / Unemployment, Family 

Structure, and Social Disorganization 


RECENT ECONOMIC TRENDS 

The Negro population in our country is as diverse in income, 
occupation, family composition, and other variables as the 
white community. Nevertheless, for purposes of analysis, three 
major Negro economic groups can be identified. 

The first and smallest group consists of middle and upper- 
income individuals and households whose educational, occu- 
pational, and cultural characteristics are similar to those of 
middle and upper-income white groups. 

The second and largest group contains Negroes whose in- 
comes are above the "poverty level" but who have not attained 
the educational, occupational, or income status typical of 
"middle-class" Americans. 

,   The third group has very low educational, occupational, and 

income attainments and lives below the "poverty level." 

i  A recent compilation of data on American Negroes by the 

Departments of Labor and Commerce shows that although 

incomes of both Negroes and whites have been rising rapidly, 

• Negro incomes still remain far below those of whites. Negro 
median family income was only 58 percent of the white median 
in 1966. 

• Negro family income is not keeping pace with white family 
income growth. In constant 1965 dollars, median nonwhite in- 
come in 1947 was $2174 lower than median white income. By 
1966, the gap had grown to $3036. 

• The Negro upper-income group is expanding rapidly and achiev- 
ing sizeable income gains. In 1966, 28 percent of all Negro 
families received incomes of $7000 or more, compared with 55 
percent of white families. This was 1.6 times the proportion of 
Negroes receiving comparable incomes in 1960, and 4 times 
greater than the proportion receiving such incomes in 1947. 
Moreover, the proportion of Negroes employed in high-skill, 
high-status, and well-paying jobs rose faster than comparable 
proportions among whites from 1960 to 1966. 

• As Negro incomes have risen, the size of the lowest-income 
group has grown smaller, and the middle and upper groups have 
grown larger — both relatively and absolutely.

• About two-thirds of the lowest-income group — or 20 percent of 
all Negroes — are making no significant economic gains despite 
continued general prosperity. Half of these hard-core disadvan- 
taged— more than two million persons — living in central-city 
neighborhoods. Recent special censuses in Los Angeles and 
Cleveland indicate that the incomes of persons living in the 
worst slum areas have not risen at all during this period, un- 
employment rates have declined only slightly, the proportion of 
families with female heads has increased, and housing condi- 
tions have worsened even though rents have risen. 

Thus, between 2.0 and 2.5 million poor Negroes are living 
in disadvantaged neighborhoods of central cities in the United 
States. These persons comprise only slightly more than 1 per- 
cent of the nation's total population, but they make up about 
16 to 20 percent of the total Negro population of all central 
cities, and a much higher proportion in certain cities. 

UNEMPLOYMENT  AND  UNDEREMPLOYMENT 

The Critical Significance of Employment 

The capacity to obtain and hold a "good job" is the tradi- 
tional test of participation in American society. Steady employ-* 
inent with adequate compensation provides both purchasing 
power and social statust It develops the capabilities, confidence, 
and self-esteem an individual needs to be a responsible citizen 
and provides a basis for a stable family life. As Daniel P. 
Moynihan has written: 

The principal measure of progress toward equality will be that 
of employment. It is the primary source of individual or group 
identity. In America what you do is what you are: to do nothing 
is to be nothing; to do little is to be little. The equations are 
implacable and blunt, and ruthlessly public. 

For the Negro American it is already, and will continue to be, 
the master problem. It is the measure of white bona fides. It 
is the measure of Negro competence, and also of the competence 
of American society. Most importantly, the linkage between 
problems of employment and the range of social pathology that 
afflicts the Negro community is unmistakable. Employment not 
only controls the present for the Negro American but, in a most 
profound way, it is creating the future as well. 

For residents of disadvantaged Negro neighborhoods, ob- 
taining good jobs is vastly more difficult than for most workers 
in society. For decades, social, economic, and psychological 

252 


disadvantages surrounding the urban Negro poor have im- 
paired their work capacities and opportunities. The result is a 
"cycle of failure" — the employment disabilities of one genera- 
tion breed those of the next 

Negro Unemployment 

Unemployment rates among Negroes have declined from a 
post-Korean War high of 12.6 percent in 1958 to 8.2 percent 
in 1967. Among married Negro men, the unemployment rate 
for 1967 was down to 3.2 percent.1 

Notwithstanding this decline, unemployment rates for 
Negroes are still double those for whites in every category, 
including married men, as they have been throughout the post- 
war period. Moreover, since 1954, even during the current ^ 
unprecedented period of sustained economic growth, unem- 
ployment among Negroes has been continuously above the 
6.0 percent "recession" level widely regarded as a sign of 
serious economic weakness when prevalent for the entire work 
force. 

While the Negro unemployment rate remains high in rela- 
tion to the white rate, the number of additional jobs needed to 
lower this to the level of white unemployment is surprisingly 
small. In 1967, approximately 3.0 million persons were un- 
employed during an average week, of whom about 638,000, 
or 21 percent, were nonwhites. When corrected for under- 
counting, total nonwhite unemployment was approximately 
712,000 or 8 percent of the nonwhite labor force. To reduce 
the unemployment rate to 3.4 percent, the rate prevalent 
among whites, jobs must be found for 57.5 percent of these 
unemployed persons. This amounts to nearly 409,000 jobs, or 
about 27 percent of the net number of new jobs added to the 
economy in the year 1967 alone and only slightly more than 
Vi oil percent of all jobs in the United States in 1967. 

The Low-Status and Low-Paying Nature of 
Many Negro Jobs 

Even more important perhaps than unemployment is the 
related problem of the undesirable nature of many jobs open 
to Negroes. Negro workers are concentrated in the lowest- 
skilled and lowest-paying occupations. These jobs often involved 
substandard wages, great instability and uncertainty of tenure? 
extremely low status in the eyes of both employer and emP* 
ployee, little or no chance for meaningful advancement, and 
unpleasant or exhausting duties. Negro men in particular are

more than three times as likely as whites to be in unskilled

This concentration in the least desirable jobs can be viewed 
another way by calculating the changes which would occur

same proportions as the male labor force as a whole (not solely 
the white labor force).

Thus, upgrading the employment of Negro men to make 
their occupational distribution identical with that of the labor 
force as a whole would have an immense impact upon the 
nature of their occupations. About 1.3 million nonwhite men — 
or 28 percent of those employed in 1966 — would move up the 
employment ladder into one of the higher-status and higher- 
paying categories. The effect of such a shift upon the incomes 
of Negro men would be very great. Using the 1966 iob distri- 


bution, the shift indicated above would nrndncfl about $4.8

reived the 1965 median income in each occupation. This 
would be a rise of approximately 30 percent in thp aminos 
artiiflllv received hv all nonwhite men in 1Q65 fnot counting 
pnv sources of income other than wages and salaries^ 

Of course, the kind of "instant upgrading" visualized in 
these calculations does not represent a practical alternative for 
national policy. The economy cannot drastically reduce the 
total number of low-status jobs it now contains, or shift large 
numbers of people upward in occupation in any short period. 
Therefore, major upgrading in the employment status of 
Isfegro men must come through a faster relative expansion of 
higher-level jobs than lower-level jobs (which has been occur- 
ring for several" decades), an improvement in the skills or 
nonwhite workers so they can obtain a higher proportion of 
those added better jobs, and a drastic reduction of discrimina- 
tory hiring and promotion practices in all enterprises, both 
private and public. 

Nevertheless, this hypothetical example clearly shows that J 

*thf> concentration of male Negro employment at the lowest" 

fod of the occupational scale is greatly depressing the incymar 

iff United States Negroes in general. Tn fact, this is the singfe 

most important source of poverty among NegroefL Itris^e^err 

more important, than unemntoYmgnti as can be shown by a 

second hypothetical calculation. In 1966, there were about 
724,000 unemployed nonwhites in the United States on the 
average, including adults and teenagers, and allowing for the 
Census Bureau undercount of Negroes. If every one of these 
persons had been employed and had received the median 
amount earned by nonwhite males in 1966 ($3,864), this 
would have added a total of $2.8 billion to nonwhite income 
as a whole. If only enough of these persons had been employed 
at that wage to reduce nonwhite unemployment from 7.3 
to 3.3 percent — the rate among whites in 1966 — then the in- 
come gain for nonwhites would have totaled about $1.5 billion. 
But if nonwhite unemployment remained at 7.3 percent, and 
nonwhite men were upgraded so that they had the same occu- 
pational distribution and incomes as all men in the labor force 
considered together, this would have produced about $4.8 
billion in additional income, as noted above (using 1965 earn- 
ings for calculation). Thus the potential income gains from 
upgrading the male nonwhite labor force are much larger than 
those from reducing nonwhite unemployment. 

This conclusion underlines the difficulty of improving the 
economic status of Negro men. It is far easier to create new 
jobs than either to create new jobs with relatively high status 
and earning power, or to upgrade existing employed or partly- 
employed workers into such better-quality employment. Yet 

255 


only such upgrading will eliminate the fundamental basis of_ 
poverty and deprivation among Negro families. ^ 

Access to good-quality jobs clearly affects the willingness of ^ 
Negro mea*actively to seek work. In riot cities surveyed by^ 
the Commission with the largest percentage of Negroes in 
skilled and semiskilled jobs, Negro men participated in the la- 
bor force to the same extent as, or greater than, white men. 
Conversely, where most Negro men were heavily concentrated 
in menial jobs, they participated less in the labor force than 
white men. 

Even given similar employment, Negro workers with the 
same education as white workers are paid less. This disparity 
doubtless results to some extent from inferior training in segre- 
gated schools, and also from the fact that large numbers of 
Negroes are only now entering certain occupations for the first 
time. However, the differentials are so large ^ fl *g yniyersal at 
all educational levels that they clearly reflect the patterns of 
discrimination which charactrize hiring and promotion prac- 
tices in many segments of the economy. For example, in 1966 
among persons who had completed high school, the median 
income of Negroes was only 73 percent that of whites. Even 
among persons with an eighth-grade education/Negro median 
income was only. 80 percent of white median income. 

At the same time, a higher proportion of Negro women than 
white women participates in the labor force at nearly all ages 
except 16 to 19. For instance, in 1966, 55 percent of nonwhite 
women from 25 to 34 years of age were employed, compared 
to only 38 percent of white women in the same age group. The 
fact that almost half of all adult Negro women work reflects 
the fact that so many Negro males have unsteady and low- 
paying jobs. Yet even though Negro women are often better 
able to find work than Negro men, the unemployment rate 
among adult nonwhite women (20 years old and over) in 1967 
was 7.1 percent, compared to the 4.3 percent rate among adult 
nonwhite men. 

Unemployment rates are, of course, much higher among 
teenagers, both Negro and white, than among adults; in fact 
about one-third of all unemployed Negroes in 1967 were be- 
tween 16 and 19 years old. During the first nine months of 
1967, the unemployment rate among nonwhite teenagers was 
26.5 percent; for whites, it was 10.6 percent. About 219,300 
nonwhite teenagers were unemployed.4 About 58,300 were 
still in school but were actively looking for jobs.

Subemployment in Disadvantaged Negro Neighborhoods 

In disadvantaged areas, employment conditions for Negroes 
are in a chronic state of crisis. Surveys in low-income neigh- 
borhoods of nine large cities made by the Department of Labor 
late in 1966 revealed that the rate of unemployment there was 
9.3 percent, compared to 7.3 percent for Negroes generally 
and 3.3 percent for whites. Moreover, a high proportion of the 
persons living in these areas were "underemployed," that is 
they were either part-time workers looking for full-time em-* 
ployment, or full-time workers earning less than $3000 per 
year, or had dropped out of the labor force. The Department 
of Labor estimated that this underemployment is two and one- 
half times greater than the number unemployed in these areas. 
Therefore, the "subemployment rate," including both the un- 
employed and the underemployed, was about 32.7 percent in" 
the nine areas surveyed, or 8.8 times greater than the overall 
unemployment rate for all U. S. workers. Since underemploy- 
ment also exists outside disadvantaged neighborhoods, com- 
paring the full subemployment rate in these areas with the 
unemployment rate for the nation as a whole is not entirely 
valid. However, it provides some measure of the enormous ! 
disparity between employment conditions in most of the nation 
and those prevalent in disadvantaged Negro areas in our large 
cities. 

The critical problem is to determine the actual number of 
those unemployed and underemployed in central-city Negro 
ghettos. This involves a process of calculation which is detailed 
in the note at the end of this chapter. The outcome of this 
process is summarized in the following table: 

Nonwhite Subemployment in Disadvantaged 
Areas of All Central Cities — 1967 

Total 
Group Unemployment   Underemployment   Subemployment 

Adult men 102,000 230,000 332,000 

Adult women 118,000 266,000 384,000 

Teenagers 98,000 220,000 318,000 

Total 818,000 716,000 1,034,000 

Therefore, in order to bring subemployment in these areas 
down to a level equal to unemployment alone among whites, 
enough steady, reasonably-paying jobs (and the training and 
motivation to perform them) must be provided to eliminate all 
underemployment and reduce unemployment by 65 percent. 
For all three age groups combined, this deficit amounted to 
923,000 jobs in 1967. 

257 


The Magnitude of Poverty in Disadvantaged 
Neighborhoods 

The chronic unemployment problems in the central city, 
aggravated by the constant arrival of new unemployed mi- 
grants, is the fundamental cause of the persistent poverty 
in disadvantaged Negro areas. 

* "Poverty'' in the affluent society is more than absolute 
deprivation. Many of the poor in the United States would be 
well-off in other societies. Relative deprivation — inequality — 
is a more useful concept of poverty with respect to the Negro 
in America because it encompasses social and political exclu- 
sion as well as economic inequality. Because of the lack of data 
of this type, we have had to focus our analysis on a measure 
of poverty which is both economic and absolute — the Social 
Security Administration's "poverty level"5 concept. It is clear, 
however, that broader measures of poverty would substantiate 
the conclusions that follow. 

In 1966 there were 29.7 million persons in the United States 
— 15.3 percent of the nation's population — with incomes below 
the "poverty level," as defined by the Social Security Adminis- 
tration. Of these, 20.3 million were white (68.3 percent), and 
9.3 million nonwhite (31.7 percent). Thus, about 11.9 percent 
of the nation's whites and 40.6 percent of its nonwhites were 
poor under the Social Security definition. 

The location of the nation's poor is best shown from 1964 
data as indicated by the following table:

• In central cities 30.7 percent of nonwhite families 
more persons lived in poverty compared to only 8.8 percent 
whites. 

• Of the 10.1 million poor persons in central cities in 1964, about 
4.4 million of these (43.6 percent) were nonwhites, and 5.7 
million (56.4 percent) were whites. The poor whites were much 
older on the average than the poor nonwhites. The proportion 
of poor persons 65 years old or older was 23.2 percent among 
whites, but only 6.8 percent among nonwhites. 

• Poverty was more than twice as prevalent among nonwhite 
families with female heads than among those with male heads, 
57 percent compared to 21 percent. In central cities, 26 percent 
of all nonwhite families of two or more persons had female 
heads, as compared to 12 percent of white families. 

• Among nonwhite families headed by a female, and having chil- 
dren under 6, the incidence of poverty was 81.0 percent. More- 
over, there were 243,000 such families living in poverty in central 
cities — or over 9 percent of all nonwhite families in those cities. 

• Among all children living in poverty within central cities, non- 
whites outnumbered whites by over 400,000. The number of 
poor nonwhite children equalled or surpassed the number of 
white poor children in every age group.

Two stark facts emerge: 

• 54 percent of all poor children in central cities in 1964 were 
nonwhites; 

• Of the 4.4 million nonwhites living in poverty within central 
cities in 1964, 52 percent were children under 16, and 61 per- 
cent were under 21. 

Since 1964, the number of nonwhite families living in pov- 
erty within central cities has remained about the same; hence, 
these poverty conditions are probably still prevalent in central 
cities in terms of absolute numbers of persons, although the 
proportion of persons in poverty may have dropped slightly.7 

TFor the nation as a whole, the proportion of nonwhite families living in 
poverty dropped from 39 percent to 35 percent from 1964 to 1966 (defining 
"family" somewhat differently from the definition used in the data above). 
The number of such families declined from 1.9 million to 1.7 million. How- 
ever, the number and proportion of all nonwhites living in central cities rose 
in the same period. As a result, the number of nonwhite families living in so- 
called "poverty areas" of large cities actually rose from 1,561,000 in 1960 to 
1,588,000 in 1966. 

259 


The Social Impact of Employment Problems 
In Disadvantaged Negro Areas 

Unemployment and the Family 

The high rates of unemployment and underemployment in 
racial ghettos are evidence, in part, that many men living in 
these areas are seeking but cannot obtain jobs which will sup- 
port a family. Perhaps equally important, most jobs they can 
get are at the low end of the occupational scale, and often lack 
the necessary status to sustain a worker's self-respect, or the 
respect of his family and friends. These same men are also 
constantly confronted with the message of discrimination: 
You are inferior because of a trait you did not cause and can- 
not change." This message reinforces feelings of inadequacy 
arising from repeated failure to obtain and keep decent jobs. 

Wives of these men are forced to work, and usually produce 
more money. If men stay at home without working, their in- 
adequacies constantly confront them and tensions arise be- 
tween them and their wives and children. Under these 
pressures, it is not surprising that many of these men flee their 
responsibilities as husbands and fathers, leaving home, and 
drifting from city to city, or adopting the style of "street 
corner men." 

I   Statistical evidence tends to document this. A close correla- 
tion exists between the number of nonwhite married women 
separated from their husbands each year and the unemploy- 
] ment rate among nonwhite males 20 years old and over. 
\ Similarly, from 1948 to 1962, the number of new Aid to 
| Families with Dependent Children cases rose and fell with the 
I nonwhite male unemployment rate. Since 1963, however, the 
number of new cases — most of them Negro children — has 
steadily increased even though the unemployment rate among 
nonwhite males has declined. The impact of marital status on 
employment among Negroes is shown by the fact that in 1967 
the proportion of married men either divorced or separated

from their wives was more than twice as high among un- 
employed nonwhite men as among employed nonwhite men. 
Moreover, among those participating in the labor force, there 
was a higher proportion of married men with wives present 
than with wives absent. 

Fatherless Families 

The abandonment of the home by many Negro males affects 
a great many children growing up in the racial ghetto. As 
previously indicated, most American Negro families are headed 
by men, just like most other American families. Yet the pro- 
portion of families with female heads is much greater among 
Negroes than among whites at all income levels, and has been 
rising in recent years. 

Proportion of Families of Various Types

1960 88.7 73.6 8.7 22.4 

1966 88.8 72.7 8.9 23.7 

This disparity between white and nonwhite families is far 
greater among the lowest income families — those most likely 
to reside in disadvantaged big-city neighborhoods — than among 
higher income families. Among families with incomes under 
$3,000 in 1966, the proportion with female heads was 42 per- 
cent for Negroes but only 23 percent for whites. In contrast, 
among families with incomes of $7,000 or more, 8 percent of 
Negro families had female heads compared to 4 percent of 
whites. 

The problems of "fatherlessness" are aggravated by the 
tendency of the poor to have large families. The average poor, 
urban nonwhite family contains 4.8 persons, as compared with 
3.7 for the average poor, urban white family. This is one of 
the primary factors in the poverty status of nonwhite house- 
holds in large cities. 

The proportion of fatherless families appears to be increas- 
ing in the poorest Negro neighborhoods. In the Hough section 
of Cleveland, the proportion of families with female heads rose 
from 23 to 32 percent from 1960 to 1965. In the Watts section 
of Los Angeles it rose from 36 to 39 percent during the same 
period. 

The handicap imposed on children growing up without 
fathers, in an atmosphere of poverty and deprivation, is in- 
creased because many mothers must work to provide support.

The following table illustrates the disparity between the pro-

in the labor force and the comparable proportion of white 
women:

With the father absent and the mother working, many ghetto 
children spend the bulk of their time on the streets — the streets 
of a crime-ridden, violence-prone and poverty-stricken world. 
The image of success in this world is not that of the "solid 
citizen," the responsible husband and father, but rather that 
of the "hustler" who promotes his own interests by exploiting 
others. The dope sellers and the numbers runners are the 
"successful" men because their earnings far outstrip those men 
who try to climb the economic ladder in honest ways. 

Young people in the ghetto are acutely conscious of a sys- 
tem which appears to offer rewards to those who illegally ex- 
ploit others, and failure to those who struggle under traditional 
responsibilities. Under these circumstances, many adopt ex- 
ploitation and the "hustle" as a way of life, disclaiming both 
work and marriage in favor of casual and temporary liaisons. 
This pattern reinforces itself from one generation to the next, 
creating a "culture of poverty" and an ingrained cynicism about 
society and its institutions. 

The "Jungle" 

The culture of poverty that results from unemployment and 
family disorganization generates a system of ruthless, exploi- 
tative relationships within the ghetto. Prostitution, dope addic- 
tion, casual sexual affairs, and crime create an environmental 
jungle characterized by personal insecurity and tension. The 
effects of this development are stark; 

• The rate of illegitimate births among nonwhite women has risen 
sharply in the past two decades. In 1940, 16.8 percent of all 
nonwhite births were illegitimate. By 1950 this proportion was 
18 percent; by 1960, 21.6 percent; by 1966, 26.3 percent. In 
the ghettos of many large cities, illegitimacy rates exceed 50 
percent. 

• The rate of illegitimacy among nonwhite women is closely re- 
lated to low income and high unemployment. In Washington, 
D. C, for example, an analysis of 1960 census tracts shows that 
in tracts with unemployment rates of 12 percent or more among 

262 


nonwhite men, illegitimacy was over 40 percent. But in tracts 
with unemployment rates of 2.9 percent and below among non- 
white men, reported illegitimacy was under 20 percent. A similar 
contrast existed between tracts in which median nonwhite in- 
come was under $4,000 (where illegitimacy was 38 percent) and 
those in which it was $8,000 and over (where illegitimacy was 11 
percent). 

• Narcotics addiction is also heavily concentrated in low-income 
Negro neighborhoods, particularly in New York City. Of the 
59,720 addicts known to the U. S. Bureau of Narcotics at the 
end of 1966, just over 50 percent were Negroes. Over 52 per- 
cent of all known addicts lived within New York State, mostly 
in Harlem and other Negro neighborhoods. These figures un- 
doubtedly greatly understate the actual number of persons using 
narcotics regularly — especially those under 21. 

• Not surprisingly, at every age from 6 through 19, the propor- 
tion of children from homes with both parents present who 
actually attend school is higher than the proportion of children 
from homes with only one parent or neither present. 

• Rates of juvenile delinquency, venereal disease, dependency upon 
AFDC support, and use of public assistance in general are much 
higher in disadvantaged Negro areas than in other parts of large 
cities. Data taken from New York City contrasting predomi- 
nantly Negro neighborhoods with the city as a whole clearly 
illustrate this fact.

In conclusion; in 1965, 1.2 million nonwhite children under 
16 lived in central city families headed by a woman under 65. 
The great majority of these children were growing up in pov- 
erty under conditions that make them better candidates for 
crime and civil disorder than for jobs providing an entry into 
American society. Because of the immense importance of this 
fact — the potential loss to the society of these young people — 
we describe these conditions in the next chapter.

Note — Calculation of Nonwhite Subemployment in 
Disadvantaged Areas of All Central Cities — 1967 

In 1967, total unemployment in the United States was dis- 
tributed as follows, by age and color: 

Group Nonwhite White Total 

Adult men 

(20 and over) 193,000 866,000 1,059,000

Adjustment for the Census Bureau undercount of nonwhite 
males in the labor force amounting to 7.5 percent for the 
teenage group, 18 percent for the adult male group and ap- 
proximately 10 percent for adult females result in the follow- 
ing revised total employment:

These figures cover the entire United States. To provide an 
estimate of the number of unemployed in disadvantaged neigh- 
borhoods within central cities, it is necessary to discover what 
proportion of the nonwhite unemployed are in central cities 
and what proportion of those in central cities are within the 
most disadvantaged neighborhoods. The Department of Labor 
survey in nine large central cities covering the first nine months 
of 1967 showed that these cities contained 27.3 percent of the 
total nonwhite labor force in the U. S., and 26.4 percent of 
total nonwhite unemployment. Hence, it is reasonable to as- 
sume that nonwhite unemployment is concentrated in central 
cities to about the same degree as the nonwhite labor force. 
In turn, the nonwhite labor force is located in central cities in 
about the same proportion as the nonwhite population, or 57.1 
percent in 1967. Thus central city unemployment among non- 
whites was presumably about 57.1 percent of the national 
figures:

Within large central cities, about 62 percent of all nonwhite 
familes lived in certain Census Tracts which have been desig- 
nated "poverty areas." These tracts ranked lowest in U. S, 
cities over 250,000 persons in size, according to an index of 
"deprivation" based upon family income, children in broken 
homes, persons with low educational attainment, males in un- 
skilled jobs, and substandard housing. On the assumption that 
conditions in these poverty areas are comparable to those in 
the nine disadvantaged areas surveyed by the Department of 
Labor in 1966, the number of unemployed nonwhites in dis- 
advantaged areas of central cities is as follows:12

Areas of all Central Cities— 1967 

Adult men 102,000 

Adult women 118,000 

Teenagers 98,000 

Total 318,000 

The number of underemployed nonwhites in these areas was 
about 2.5 times larger than the number of unemployed. But 
we have already accounted for some underemployment in the 
adjustment for undercounting — so we will assume nonwhite 
underemployment was 2.25 times adjusted unemployment for 
all three age and sex groups. The resulting rough estimates 
are as follows: 

Nonwhite Subemployment in Disadvantaged 
Areas of All Central Cities— 1967 

Total 
Group Unemployment   Underemployment Subemployment 

Adult men 102,000 230,000 332,000 

Adult women 118,000 266,000 384,000 

Teenagers 98,000 220,000 318,000 

Total 318,000 716,000 1,034,000 

12 The number of nonwhite unemployed in the more disadvantaged areas 
was 26 percent higher than it would have been had it been proportional to the 
total population residing there. Therefore, the proportion of central city non- 
white unemployed in poverty areas is assumed to equal 78.1 percent (62 per- 
cent times 1.26).

Chapter 8 / Conditions of Life in the 
Racial Ghetto 

The conditions of life in the racial ghetto are strikingly dif- 
ferent from those to which most Americans are accustomed — 
especially white, middle-class Americans. We believe it im- 
portant to describe these conditions and their effect on the 
lives of people who cannot escape from the ghetto. 

(We have not attempted here to describe conditions relating 
to the fundamental problems of housing, education and wel- 
fare, which are treated in detail in later chapters.) 

I. Crime and Insecurity 

Nothing is more fundamental to the quality of life in any 
area than the sense of personal security of its residents, and 
nothing affects this more than crime. 

In general, crime rates in large cities are much higher than 
in other areas of our country. Within such cities, crime rates 
are higher in disadvantaged Negro areas than anywhere else. 

The most widely-used measure of crime is the number of 
"index crimes" (homicide, forcible rape, aggravated assault, 
robbery, burglary, grand larcency, and auto theft) in relation 
to population. In 1966, 1,754 such crimes were reported to 
police for every 100,000 Americans. In cities over 250,000, 
the rate was 3,153, and in cities over one million, it was 3,630 
— or more than double the national average. In suburban areas 
alone, including suburban cities, the rate was only 1,300, or 
just over one-third the rate in the largest cities. 

Within larger cities, personal and property insecurity has 
consistently been highest in the older neighborhoods encircling 
the downtown business district. In most cities, crime rates for 
many decades have been higher in these inner areas than any- 
where else, except in downtown areas themselves where they 
are inflated by the small number of residents. 

High crime rates have persisted in these inner areas even 
though the ethnic character of their residents continually 
changed. Poor immigrants used these areas as "entry ports," 
then usually moved on to more desirable neighborhoods as 
soon as they acquired enough resources. Many "entry port" 
areas have now become racial ghettos. 

The difference between crime rates in these disadvantaged 
neighborhoods and in other parts of the city is usually startling, 
as a comparison of crime rates in five police districts in Chi- 
cago for 1965 illustrates. These five include one high-income, 

266 


all-white district at the periphery of the city, two very low- 
income, virtually all-Negro districts near the city core with nu- 
merous public housing projects, and two predominantly white 
districts, one with mainly lower-middle-income families, the 
other containing a mixture of very high-income and relatively 
low-income households. The table shows crime rates against 
persons and against property in these five districts, plus the 
number of patrolmen assigned to them per 100,000 residents, 
as follows:

291 


These data suggest the following conclusions: 

• Variations in the crime rate against persons within the city are 
extremely large. One very low-income Negro district had 35 
times as many serious crimes against persons per 100,000 resi- 
dents as did the high-income white district. 

• Variations in the crime rate against property are much smaller. 
The highest rate was only 2.5 times larger than the lowest. 

• The lower the income in an area, the higher the crime rate there. 
Yet low-income Negro areas have significantly higher crime 
rates than low-income white areas. This reflects the high degree 
of social disorganization in Negro areas described in the pre- 
vious chapter, as well as the fact that poor Negroes, as a 
group, have lower incomes than poor whites, as a group. 

• The presence of more police patrolmen per 100,000 residents 
does not necessarily offset high crime in certain parts of the city. 
Although the Chicago Police Department had assigned over 
three times as many patrolmen per 100,000 residents to the 
highest-crime areas shown as to the lowest, crime rates in the 
highest-crime area for offenses against both persons and property 
combined were 4.9 times as high as in the lowest-crime area. 

^ Because most middle-class Americans live in neighborhoods 
similar to the more crime-free district described above, they 
have little comprehension of the sense of insecurity that char- 
acterizes the ghetto resident. Moreover, official statistics 
normally greatly understate actual crime rates because the 
vast majority of crimes are not reported to the police. For 

267 


example, studies conducted for the President's Crime Com- 
mission in Washington, D. C, Boston, and Chicago, showed 
that three to six times as many crimes were actually committed 
against persons and homes as were reported to the police. 

Two facts are crucial to an understanding of the effects of 
high crime rates in racial ghettos: most of these crimes are 
committed by a small minority of the residents, and the prin- 
cipal victims are the residents themselves. Throughout the 
United States, the great majority of crimes committed by Ne- 
groes involve other Negroes as victims. A special tabulation 
made by the Chicago Police Department for the President's 
Crime Commission indicated that over 85 percent of the 
crimes committed against persons by Negroes between Septem- 
ber 1965 and March 1966 involved Negro victims. 

As a result, the majority of law-abiding citizens who live 
in disadvantaged Negro areas face much higher probabilities 
of being victimized than residents of most higher-income areas, 
including almost all suburbs. For nonwhites, the probability 
of suffering from any index crime except larceny is 78 per- 
cent higher than for whites. The probability of being raped is 
3.7 times higher among nonwhite women, and the probability 
of being robbed is 3.5 times higher for nonwhites in general. 

The problems associated with high crime rates generate 
widespread hostility toward the police in these neighborhoods 
for reasons described elsewhere in this Report. Thus, crime 
not only creates an atmosphere of insecurity and fear through- 
out Negro neighborhoods but also causes continuing attrition 
of the relationship between Negro residents and police. This 
bears a direct relationship to civil disorder. 

There are reasons to expect the crime situation in these 
areas to become worse in the future. First, crime rates through- 
out the United States have been rising rapidly in recent years. 
The rate of index crimes against persons rose 37 percent from 
1960 to 1966, and the rate of index crimes against property 
rose 50 percent. In the first nine months of 1967, the num- 
ber of index crimes was up 16 percent over the same period 
in 1966 whereas the United States population rose about one 
percent. In cities of 250,000 to one million, index crime rose 
by over 20 percent, whereas it increased four percent in cities 
of over one million.1 

Second, the number of police available to combat crime is 
rising much more slowly than the amount of crime. In 1966, 

1The problem of interpreting and evaluating "rising" crime rates is com- 
plicated by the changing age distribution of the population, improvements in 
reporting methods, and the increasing willingness of victims to report crimes. 
Despite these complications, there is general agreement on the serious increase 
in the incidence of crime in the United States. 

268 


there were about 20 percent more police employees in the 
United States than in 1960, and per capita expenditures for 
police rose from $15.29 in 1960 to $20.99 in 1966, a gain of 
37 percent. But over the six-year period, the number of re- 
ported index crimes had jumped 62 percent. In spite of sig- 
nificant improvements in police efficiency, it is clear that police 
will be unable to cope with their expanding workload unless 
there is a dramatic increase in the resources allocated by so- 
ciety to this task. 

Third, in the next decade the number of young Negroes 
aged 14 to 24 will increase rapidly, particularly in central 
cities. This group is responsible for a disproportionately high 
share of crimes in all parts of the nation. In 1966, persons 
under 25 years of age comprised the following proportions 
of those arrested for various major crimes: murder — 37 per- 
cent; forcible rape — 64 percent; robbery — 71 percent; burglary 
— 81 percent; larceny — about 77 percent; and auto theft — over 
89 percent. For all index crimes together, the arrest rate for 
Negroes is about four times higher than that for whites. Yet 
the number of young Negroes aged 14 to 24 in central cities 
will rise about 63 percent from 1966 to 1975, as compared to 
only 32 percent for the total Negro population of central 
cities.2 

II. Health and Sanitation Conditions 

The residents of the racial ghetto are significantly less 
healthy than most other Americans. They suffer from higher 
mortality rates, higher incidence of major diseases, and lower 
availability and utilization of medical services. They also ex- 
perience higher admission rates to mental hospitals. 

These conditions result from a number of factors. 

Poverty 

From the standpoint of health, poverty means deficient diets, 
lack of medical care, inadequate shelter and clothing, and 
often lack of awareness of potential health needs. As a result, 
about 30 percent of all persons with family incomes less than 
$2,000 per year suffer from chronic health conditions that 
adversely affect their employment — as compared with less than 
8 percent of the families with incomes of $7,000 or more. 

Poor families have the greatest need for financial assistance 

2 Assuming those cities will experience the same proportion of total United 
States Negro population growth that they did from 1960 to 1966. The calcula- 
tions are derived from population projections in Bureau of the Census, 
Population Estimates, Current Population Reports, Series P-25, No. 381. Dec. 
18, 1967, p. 63. 

269 


in meeting medical expenses. Only about 34 percent of families 
with incomes of less than $2,000 per year use health insurance 
benefits, as compared to nearly 90 percent of those with in- 
comes of $7,000 or more.3 

These factors are aggravated for Negroes when compared 
to whites for the simple reason that the proportion of persons 
in the United States who are poor is 3.5 times as high among 
Negroes (41 percent in 1966) as among whites (12 percent 
in 1966). 

Maternal Mortality 

Mortality rates for nonwhite mothers are four times as high 
as those for white mothers. There has been a sharp decline in 
such rates since 1940, when 774 nonwhite and 320 white 
mothers died for each 100,000 live births. In 1965, only 84 
nonwhite and 21 white mothers died per 100,000 live births — 
but the relative gap between non-whites and whites actually 
increased. 

Infant Mortality 

Mortality rates among nonwhite babies are 58 percent higher 
than among whites for those under one month old, and almost 
three times as high among those from one month to one year 
old. This is true in spite of a large drop in infant mortality 
rates in both groups since 1940.

Life Expectancy 

To some extent because of infant mortality rates, life ex- 
pectancy at birth was 6.9 years longer for whites (71.0 years) 
than for nonwhites (64.1 years) in 1965. Even in the prime 

8 Public programs of various kinds have been providing significant financial 
assistance for medical care in recent years. In 1964, over $1.1 billion was 
paid out by various governments for such aid. About 52 percent of medical 
vendor payments came from federal government agencies, 33 percent from 
states, and 12 percent from local governments. The biggest contributions were 
made by the Old Age Assistance program and the Medical Assistance for the 
Aged program. The enactment of Medicare in 1965 has significantly added to 
this flow of public assistance for medical aid. However, it is too early to 
evaluate the results upon health conditions among the poor. 

270 


working ages, life expectancy is significantly lower among 
nonwhites than among whites. In 1965, white persons 25 
years old could expect to live an average of 48.6 more years; 
whereas nonwhites 25 years old could expect to live another 
43.3 years, or 11 percent less. Similar but smaller discrepancies 
existed at all ages from 25 through 55; some actually increased 
♦ slightly between 1960 and 1965. 

Lower Utilization of Health Services 

A fact that also contributes to poorer health conditions in 
the ghetto is that Negro families with incomes similar to those 
of whites spend less on medical services and visit medical spe- 
cialists less often.

Since the lowest income group contains a much larger pro- 
portion of nonwhite families than white families, the overall 
discrepancy in medical care spending between these two groups 
is very significant, as shown by the following table:

These data indicate that nonwhite families in the lower 
income group spent less than half as much per person on 
medical services as white families with similar incomes. This 
discrepancy sharply declines but is still significant in the 
higher income group, where total nonwhite medical expendi- 
tures per person equal, on the average, 74.3 percent of white 
expenditures. 

Negroes spend less on medical care for several reasons. 
Negro households generally are larger, requiring larger non- 
medical expenses for each household, and leaving less money 

271 


for meeting medical expenses. Thus lower expenditures per 
person would result even if expenditures per household were 
the same. Negroes also often pay more for other basic necessi- 
ties such as food and consumer durables, as discussed in the 
next part of this chapter. In addition, fewer doctors, dentists, 
and medical facilities are conveniently available to Negroes 
than to most whites. This is a result both of geographic con- 
centration of doctors in higher income areas in large cities and 
of discrimination against Negroes by doctors and hospitals. A 
survey in Cleveland indicated that there were 0.45 physicians 
per 1,000 people in poor neighborhoods, compared to 1.13 per 
1,000 in nonpoverty areas. The result nationally is fewer visits 
to physicians and dentists.

Although widespread use of health insurance has led many 
hospitals to adopt nondiscriminatory policies, some private 
hospitals still refuse to admit Negro patients or to accept doc- 
tors with Negro patients. And many individual doctors still 
discriminate against Negro patients. As a result, Negroes are 
more likely to be treated in hospital clinics than whites, and 
they are less likely to receive personalized service. This con-

Environmental Factors 

Environmental conditions in disadvantaged Negro neigh- 
borhoods create further reasons for poor health conditions 
there. The level of sanitation is strikingly below that which 

272 


is prevalent in most higher income areas. One simple reason 
is that residents often lack proper storage facilities for food — 
adequate refrigerators, freezers, even garbage cans which are 
sometimes stolen as fast as landlords can replace them. 

In many areas where garbage collection and other sanita- 
tion services are grossly inadequate — commonly in the poorer 
parts of our large cities, rats proliferate. It is estimated that 
in 1965, there were over 14,000 cases of rat-bite in the United 
States, mostly in such neighborhoods. 

The importance of these conditions was outlined for the 
Commission as follows:4 

Sanitation Commissioners of New York City and Chicago 
both feel this [sanitation] to be an important community prob- 
lem and report themselves as being under substantial pressure 
to improve conditions. // must be concluded that slum sanitation 
is a serious problem in the minds of the urban poor and well 
merits, at least on that ground, the attention of the Commission. 
A related problem, according to one Sanitation Commissioner, 
is the fact that residents of areas bordering on slums feel that 
sanitation and neighborhood cleanliness is a crucial issue, re- 
lating to the stability of their blocks and constituting an im- 
portant psychological index of "how far gone" their area is. 

.... There is no known study comparing sanitation services 
between slum and nonslum areas. The experts agree, however, 
that there are more services in the slums on a quantitative basis, 
although perhaps not on a per capita basis. In New York, for ex- 
ample, garbage pickups are supposedly scheduled for about six 
times a week in slums, compared to three times a week in other 
areas of the city; the comparable figures in Chicago are two-three 
times a week versus once a week. 

The point, therefore, is not the relative quantitative level of 
services, but the peculiarly intense needs of ghetto areas for sani- 
tation services. This high demand is the product of numerous 
factors including: (1) higher population density; (2) lack of 
well managed buildings and adequate garbage services provided 
by landlords, number of receptacles, carrying to curbside, num- 
ber of electric garbage disposals; (3) high relocation rates of 
tenants and businesses, producing heavy volume of bulk refuse 
left on streets and in buildings; (4) different uses of the streets 
— as outdoor living rooms in summer, recreation areas — pro- 
ducing high visibility and sensitivity to garbage problems; (5) 
large numbers of abandoned cars; (6) severe rodent and pest 
problems; (7) traffic congestion blocking garbage collection; 
and (8) obstructed street cleaning and snow removal on crowded, 
car-choked streets. Each of these elements adds to the problem 
and suggests a different possible line of attack.

III. Exploitation of Disadvantaged Consumers 
By Retail Merchants 

Much of the violence in recent civil disorders has been 
directed at stores and other commercial establishments in dis- 
advantaged Negro areas. In some cases, rioters focused on 
stores operated by white merchants who, they apparently be- 
lieved, had been charging exorbitant prices or selling inferior 
goods. Not all the violence against these stores can be attributed 
to "revenge" for such practices. Yet it is clear that many resi- 
dents of disadvantaged Negro neighborhoods believe they 
suffer constant abuses by local merchants. 

Significant grievances concerning unfair commercial prac- 
tices affecting Negro consumers were found in 1 1 of the 20 
cities studied by the Commission. The fact that most of the 
merchants who operate stores in Negro areas are white un- 
doubtedly contributes to the conclusion among Negroes that 
they are exploited by white society. 

It is difficult to assess the precise degree and extent of ex- 
ploitation. No systematic and reliable survey comparing con- 
sumer pricing and credit practices in all-Negro and other 
neighborhoods has ever been conducted on a nationwide basis. 
Differences in prices and credit practices between white mid- 
dle-income areas and Negro low-income areas to some extent 
reflect differences in the real costs of serving these two markets 
(such as differential losses from pilferage in supermarkets), 
but the exact extent of these cost differences has never been 
estimated accurately. Finally, an examination of exploita- 
tive consumer practices must consider the particular struc- 
ture and functions of the low-income consumer durables 
market. 

Installment Buying 

This complex situation can best be understood by first con- 
sidering certain basic facts: 

• Various cultural factors generate constant pressure on low- 
income families to buy many relatively expensive durable goods 
and display them in their homes. This pressure comes in part 
from continuous exposure to commercial advertising, especially 
on television. In January 1967, over 88 percent of all Negro 
households had TV sets. A 1961 study of 464 low-income fami- 
lies in New York City showed that 95 percent of these relatively 
poor families had TV sets. 

• Many poor families have extremely low incomes, bad previous 
credit records, unstable sources of income, or other attributes 
which make it virtually impossible for them to buy merchandise 

274 


from established large national or local retail firms. These fami- 
lies lack enough savings to pay cash, and they cannot meet the 
standard credit requirements of established general merchants 
because they are too likely to fall behind in their payments. 

• Poor families in urban areas are far less mobile than others^ A 
1967 Chicago study of low-income Negro households indicated 
their low automobile ownership compelled them to patronize 
neighborhood merchants. These merchants typically provided 
smaller selection, poorer services, and higher prices than big1 
national outlets. The 1961 New York study also indicated that 
families who shopped outside their own neighborhoods were far 
less likely to pay exorbitant prices. ^ 

• Most low-income families are uneducated concerning the nature' 
of credit purchase contracts, the legal rights and obligations of 
both buyers and sellers, sources of advice for consumers who 
are having difficulties with merchants, and the operation of the 
courts concerned with these matters. In contrast, merchants en- 
gaged in selling goods to them are very well informed. 

• In most states, the laws governing relations between consumers 
and merchants in effect offer protection only to informed, so- 
phisticated parties with understanding of each other's rights 
and obligations. Consequently, these laws are little suited to 
protect the rights of most low-income consumers. 

In this situation, exploitative practices flourish. Ghetto resi- 
dents who want to buy relatively expensive goods cannot do 
so from standard retail outlets and are thus restricted to local 
stores. Forced to use credit, they have little understanding of 
the pitfalls of credit buying. But because they have unstable 
incomes and frequently fail to make payments, the cost to the 
merchants of serving them is significantly above that of serv- 
ing middle-income consumers. Consequently, a special kind 
of merchant appears to sell them goods on terms designed to 
cover the high cost of doing business in ghetto neighborhoods. 

Whether they actually gain higher profits, these merchant^ 
charge higher prices than those in other narts of the citv to 
cover the greater credit risks and other higher operating costs 
inherent jp neighborhood outlets. A recent study conducted 
by the Federal Trade Commission in Washington, D. C, illus- 
trates this conclusion dramatically. The FTC identified a num- 
ber of stores specializing in selling furniture and appliances to 
low-income households. About 92 percent of the sales of these 
stores were credit sales involving installment purchases, as 
compared to 27 percent of the sales in general retail outlets 
handling the same merchandise. 

The median income annually of a sample of 486 customers 
of these stores was about $4,200, but one-third had annual 
incomes below $3,600, about 6 percent were receiving wel- 
fare payments, and another 76 percent were employed in the 

275 


lowest paying occupations (service workers, operatives, labor- 
ers, and domestics) — as compared to 36 percent of the total 
labor force in Washington in those occupations. 

Definitely catering to a low-income group, these stores 
charged significantly higher prices than general merchandise 
putlets in the Washington area. According to testimony by 
JPaul Rand Dixon, Chairman of the FTC, an item selling 
wholesale at $100 would retail on the average for $165 in a 
general merchandise store, and for $250 in a low-income spe- 
cialty store. Thus, the customers of these outlets were paying 
an average price premium of about 52 percent. 

While higher prices are not necessarily exploitative in them- 
selves, many merchants in ghetto neighborhoods take advan- 
tage of their superior knowledge of credit buying by engaging 
in various exploitative tactics — high-pressure salesmanship, 
bait advertising, misrepresentation of prices, substitution of 
used goods for promised new ones, failure to notify consumers 
of legal actions against them, refusal to repair or replace sub- 
standard goods, exorbitant prices or credit charges, and use 
! of shoddy merchandise. Such tactics affect a great many low- 
income consumers. In the New York study, 60 percent of all 
households had suffered from consumer problems (some of 
which were purely their own fault) , about 23 percent had ex- 
perienced serious exploitation. Another 20 percent, many of 
whoirf were also exploited, had experienced repossession, gar- 
nishment, or threat of garnishment. 

Garnishment 

Garnishment practices in many states allow creditors to de- 
prive individuals of their wages through court action without 
hearing or trial. In about 20 states, the wages of an employee 
can be diverted to a creditor merely upon the latter's deposit 
tion, with no advance hearing where the employee can defend 
himself. He often receives no prior notice of such action an<t 
is usually unaware of the law's operation and too poor to hire 
legal defense. Moreover, consumers may find themselves still 
owing money on a sales contract even after the creditor has 
repossessed the goods. The New York study cited earlier in 
this chapter indicated that 20 percent of a sample of low- 
income families had been subject to legal action regarding 
consumer purchases. And the Federal Trade Commission study 
in Washington, D. C, showed that, on the average, retailers 
specializing in credit sales of furniture and appliances to low- 
income consumers resorted to court action once for every 
$2,200 of sales. Since their average sale was for $207, this 
amounted to using the courts to collect from one of every 11 

276 


customers. In contrast, department stores in the same area 
used court action against approximately one of every 14,500 


Variations in Food Prices 

Residents of low-income Negro neighborhoods frequently 
claim that they pay higher prices for food in local markets 
than wealthier white suburbanites and receive inferior quality 
meat and produce. Statistically reliable information comparing 
prices and quality in these two kinds of areas is generally un- 
available. The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, studying food 
prices in six cities in 1966, compared prices of a standard 
list of 18 items in low-income areas and higher-income areas 
in each city. In a total of 180 stores, including independent 
and chain stores, and for items of the same type sold in the 
same types of stores, there were no significant differences in 
prices between low-income and high-income areas. However, 
stores in low-inyome areas were more likely to he small in- 
dependents (whicn had somewhat higher prices), to sell low- 
Quality produce and meat at anv given price, and to he patron- 
ized bv people who tvpicallv bought smaller-sized packages 
which are more expensive per unit of measure. In other words v 
many low-income considers in fact pav higher prices, al- 
though the situation varies greatly from place to place. 

Although these findings must be considered inconclusive, 
there are significant reasons to believe that poor hcn^e|)p)dg 
generally pav higher prices for the food thev hnv and receive 
inwer quality fnndT Low-income consumers buy more food 
at local groceries because they are less mobile. Prices in these 
small stores are significantly higher than in major supermarkets 
because they cannot achieve economies of scale, and because 
real operating costs are higher in low-income Negro areas than 
in outlying suburbs. For instance, inventory "shrinkage" from 
pilfering and other causes is normally under 2 percent of sales, 
but can run twice as much in high-crime areas. Managers seek 
to make up for these added costs by charging higher prices 
for food, or by substituting lower grades. 

These practices do not necessarily involve exploitation, 
but they are often perceived as exploitative and unfair by those 
who are aware of the price and quality differences involved, 
but unaware of operating costs. In addition, it is probable 
that genuinely exploitative pricing practices exist in some areas. 
In either case, differential food prices constitute another fac- 
tor convincing urban Negroes in low-income neighborhoods 
that whites discriminate against them. 

6 Assuming their sales also averaged $207 per customer.

Chapter 9 / Comparing the Immigrant 
and Negro Experience 


We have in the preceding chapters surveyed the historical 
background of racial discrimination and traced its effects on 
Negro employment, on the social structure of the ghetto com- 
munity, and on the conditions of life that surround the urban 
Negro poor. Here we address a fundamental question that 
many white Americans are asking today: why has the Negro 
been unable to escape from poverty and the ghetto like the 
European immigrants? 

The Maturing Economy 

The changing nature of the American economy is one majdt 
* reason. When the European immigrants were arriving in large 
numbers, America was becoming an urban-industrial society. 
To build its major cities and industries, America needed great 
spools of unskilled labor. The immigrants provided the labor, 
gained an economic foothold, and thereby enabled their chil- 
dren and grandchildren to move up to skilled, white collar, and 
professional employment. 

Since World War II, especially, America's urban-industrial 
society has matured; unskilled labor is far less essential thdh 
before, and blue-collar jobs of all kinds af e decreasing in num- 
ber and importance as a source of new employment. The 
Negroes who migrated to the great urban centers lacked the 
skills essential to the new economy; and the schools of the 
5 ghetto have been unable to provide the education that can 
4 qualify them for decent jobs. The Negro migrant, unlike the 
immigrant, found little opportunity in the city; he had arrived 
too late, and the unskilled labor he had to offer was no longer 
needed. 

The Disability of Race 

Racial discrimination is undoubtedly the second major 
reason why the Negro has been unable to escape from poverty. 
The structure of discrimination has persistently narrowed his 
opportunities and restricted his prospects. Well before the high 
tide of immigration from overseas, Negroes were already rele- 
gated to the poorly paid, low status occupations. Had it not 
been for racial discrimination, the North might well have re- 

278 


f cruited Southern Negroes after the Civil War to provide the 
J labor for building the burgeoning urban-industrial economy. 
I Instead, Northern employers looked to Europe for their 
sources of unskilled labor. Upon the arrival of the immigrants, 
the Negroes were dislodged from the few urban occupations 
they had dominated. Not until World War II were Negroes 
generally hired for industrial jobs, and by that time the de- 
cline in the need for unskilled labor had already begun. 
European immigrants, too, suffered from discrimination, but 
never was it so pervasive. The prejudice against color in 
America has formed a bar to advancement unlike any other. 

Entry into the Political System 

Political opportunities also played an important role in 
enabling the European immigrants to escape from poverty. 
The immigrants settled for the most part in rapidly growing 
cities that had powerful and expanding political machines, 
which gave them economic advantages in exchange for politi- 
cal support. The political machines were decentralized; and 
ward-level grievance machinery, as well as personal represen- 
tation, enabled the immigrant to make his voice heard and his 
power felt. Since the local political organizations exercised 
considerable influence over public building in the cities, they 
provided employment in construction jobs for their immigrant 
voters. Ethnic groups often dominated one or more of the 
municipal services — police and fire protection, sanitation, and 
even public education. 

By the time the Negroes arrived, the situation had altered 
dramatically. The great wave of public building had virtually 
come to an end; reform groups were beginning to attack the 
political machines; the machines were no longer so powerful 
or so well equipped to provide jobs and other favors. 

Although the political machines retained their hold over the 
areas settled by Negroes, the scarcity of patronage jobs made 
them unwilling to share with the Negroes the political positions 
they had created in these neighborhoods. For example, Harlem 
was dominated by white politicians for many years after it had 
become a Negro ghetto; even today, New York's Lower East 
Side, which is now predominantly Puerto Rican, is strongly 
influenced by politicians of the older immigrant groups. 

This pattern exists in many other American cities. Negroes 
are still underrepresented in city councils and in most city 
agencies. 

Segregation played a role here too. The immigrants and 
their descendants, who felt threatened by the arrival of the 

279 


Negro, prevented a Negro-immigrant coalition that might have 
saved the old political machines. Reform groups, nominally 
more liberal on the race issue, were often dominated by busi- 
nessmen and middle-class city residents who usually opposed 
coalition with any low-income group, white or black. 

Cultural Factors 

Cultural factors also made it easier for the immigrants to 
escape from poverty. They came to America from much 
poorer societies, with a low standard of living, and they came 
at a time when job aspirations were low. When most jobs in 
the American economy were unskilled, they sensed little dep- 
rivation in being forced to take the dirty and poorly paid jobs. 
Moreover, their families were large, and many breadwinners, 
some of whom never married, contributed to the total family 
income. As a result, family units managed to live even from 
the lowest paid jobs and still put some money aside for savings 
or investment, for example, to purchase a house or tenement, 
or to open a store or factory. Since the immigrants spoke little 
English and had their own ethnic culture, they needed stores 
to supply them with ethnic foods and other services. Since 
their family structures were patriarchal, men found satisfac- 
tions in family life that helped compensate for the bad jobs 
they had to take and the hard work they had to endure. 

Negroes came to the city under quite different circum- 
stances. Generally relegated to jobs that others would not 
take, they were paid too little to be able to put money in 
savings for new enterprises. In addition, Negroes lacked the 
extended family characteristics of certain European groups 
— each household usually had only one or two bread- 
winners. Moreover, Negro men had fewer cultural incentives 
to work in a dirty job for the sake of the family. As a result 
of slavery and of long periods of male unemployment after- 
wards, the Negro family structure had become matriarchal; 
the man played a secondary and marginal role in his family. 
For many Negro men, then, there were few of the cultural 
and psychological rewards of family life; they often aban- 
doned their homes because they felt themselves useless to 
their families. 

Although Negro men worked as hard as the immigrants to 
support their families, their rewards were less. The jobs did not 
pay enough to enable them to support their families, for prices 
and living standards had risen since the immigrants had come, 
and the entrepreneurial opportunities that had allowed some 
immigrants to become independent, even rich, had vanished. 
Above all, Negroes suffered from segregation, which denied 

280 


them access to the good jobs and the right unions and which 
deprived them of the opportunity to buy real estate or obtain 
business loans or move out of the ghetto and bring up their 
children in middle-class neighborhoods. Immigrants were able 
to leave their ghettos as soon as they had the money; segrega- 
tion has denied Negroes the opportunity to live elsewhere. 

The Vital Element of Time 

Finally, nostalgia makes it easy to exaggerate the ease of 
escape of the white immigrants from the ghettos. When the 
immigrants were immersed in poverty, they too lived in slums, 
and these neighborhoods exhibited fearfully high rates of alco- 
holism, desertion, illegitimacy, and the other pathologies asso- 
ciated with poverty. Just as some Negro men desert their 
families when they are unemployed and their wives can get 
jobs, so did the men of other ethnic groups, even though time 
and affluence has clouded white memories of the past. 

Today, whites tend to contrast their experience with 
poverty-stricken Negroes. The fact is, among many of the 
Southern and Eastern Europeans who came to America in the 
last great wave of immigration, those who came already urban- 
ized were the first to escape from poverty. The others who 
came to America from rural backgrounds, as Negroes did, are 
only now, after three generations, in the final stages of escaping 
from poverty. Until the last 10 years or so, most of these were 
employed in blue-collar jobs, and only a small proportion of 
their children were able or willing to attend college. In other 
words, only the third, and in many cases, only the fourth 
generation has been able to achieve the kind of middle-class 
income and status that allows it to send its children to college. 
Because of favorable economic and political conditions, these 
ethnic groups were able to escape from lower-class status to 
working class and lower middle-class status, but it has taken 
them three generations. 

Negroes have been concentrated in the city for only two 
generations, and they have been there under much less favor- 
able conditions. Moreover, their escape from poverty has been 
blocked in part by the resistance of the European ethnic 
groups; they have been unable to enter some unions and to 
move into some neighborhoods outside the ghetto because 
descendants of the European immigrants who control these 
unions and neighborhoods have not yet abandoned them for 
middle-class occupations and areas. 

Even so, some Negroes have escaped poverty, and they have 
done so in only two generations; their success is less visible 
than that of the immigrants in many cases, for residential 

281 


segregation has forced them to remain in the ghetto. Still, the 
proportion of nonwhites employed in white-collar, technical, 
and professional jobs has risen from 10.2 percent in 1950 to 
20.8 percent in 1966, and the proportion attending college has 
risen an equal amount. Indeed, the development of a small but 
steadily increasing Negro middle class while the greater part 
of the Negro population is stagnating economically is creating a 
growing gap between Negro haves and have-nots. 

This gap, as well as the awareness of its existence by those 
left behind, undoubtedly adds to the feelings of desperation and 
anger which breed civil disorders. Low-income Negroes realize 
that segregation and lack of job opportunities have made it 
possible for only a small proportion of all Negroes to escape 
poverty and the summer disorders are at least in part a protest 
against being left behind and left out. 

The immigrant who labored long hours at hard and often 
menial work had the hope of a better future, if not for himself 
then for his children. This was the promise of the "American 
dream" — the society offered to all a future that was open- 
ended; with hard work and perseverance, a man and his 
family could in time achieve not only material well-being but 
"position" and status. 

For the Negro family in the urban ghetto, there is a different 
vision — the future seems to lead only to a dead-end. 

What the American economy of the late 19th and early 
20th century was able to do to help the European immigrants 
escape from poverty is now largely impossible. New methods 
of escape must be found for the majority of today's poor.

PART III 

WHAT CAN 

BE 

DONE? 

* 

Chapter 10 / The Community Response 


Introduction 

The racial disorders of last summer in part reflect the failure 
of all levels of government — federal and state as well as local 
— to come to grips with the problems of our cities. The ghetto 
symbolizes the dilemma: a widening gap between human needs 
and public resources and a growing cynicism regarding the 
commitment of community institutions and leadership to meet 
these needs. 

The problem has many dimensions — financial, political and 
institutional. Almost all cities — and particularly the central 
cities of the largest metropolitan regions — are simply unable 
to meet the growing need for public services and facilities 
with traditional sources of municipal revenue. Many cities are 
structured politically so that great numbers of citizens — par- 
ticularly minority groups — have little or no representation in 
the processes of government. Finally, some cities lack either 
the will or the capacity to use effectively the resources that 
are available to them. 

Instrumentalities of federal and state government often com- 
pound the problems. National policy expressed through a very 
large number of grant programs and institutions rarely exhibits 
a coherent and consistent perspective when viewed at the local 
level. State efforts, traditionally focused on rural areas, often 
fail to tie in effectively with either local or federal programs 
in urban areas. 

Meanwhile, the decay of the central city continues — its reve- 
nue base eroded by the retreat of industry and white middle- 
class families to the suburbs, its budget and tax rate inflated by 
rising costs and increasing numbers of dependent citizens and 
its public plant — schools, hospitals and correctional institutions 
— deteriorated by age and long deferred maintenance. 

Yet to most citizens, the decay remains largely invisible. 

283 


Only their tax bills and the headlines about crime or "riots" 
suggest that something may be seriously wrong in the city. 

There are, however, two groups of people that live con- 
stantly with the problem of the city: the public officials and 
the poor, particularly the residents of the racial ghetto. Their 
relationship is a key factor in the development of conditions 
underlying civil disorders. 

Our investigations of the 1967 riot cities establishes that: 

• Virtually every major episode of urban violence in the summer 
of 1967 was foreshadowed by an accumulation of unresolved 
grievances by ghetto residents against local authorities (often, 
but not always, the police). So high was the resulting under- 
lying tension, that routine and random events, tolerated or ig- 
nored under most circumstances (such as the raid on the "Blind 
Pig" in Detroit and the arrest of the cab driver in Newark) be- 
came the triggers of sudden violence. 

• Coinciding with this high level of dissatisfaction, confidence 
in the willingness and ability of local government to respond to 
Negro grievances was low. Evidence presented to this Commis- 
sion in hearings, field reports and research analyses of the 1967 
riot cities, establishes that a substantial number of Negroes were 
disturbed and angry about local governments* failures to solve 
their problems. 

Several developments have converged to produce this vola- 
tile situation. 

First, there is a widening gulf in communications between 
local government and the residents of the erupting ghettos of 
the city. As a result, many Negro citizens develop a profound 
sense of isolation and alienation from the processes and pro- 
grams of government. This lack of communication exists for all 
residents in our larger cities; it is, however, far more difficult to 
overcome for low income, less educated citizens who are dis- 
proportionately supported by and dependent upon programs 
administered by agencies of local government. Consequently, 
they are more often subject to real or imagined official mis- 
conduct ranging from abrasive contacts with public officials to 
arbitrary administrative actions. 

'■ Further, as a result of the long history of racial discrimina- 
tion, grievances experienced by Negroes often take on personal 
and symbolic significance transcending the immediate conse- 
quences of the event. For example, inadequate sanitation serv- 
ices are viewed by many ghetto residents not merely as in- 
stances of poor public service but as manifestations of racial 
discrimination. This perception reinforces existing feelings of 
alienation and contributes to a heightened level of frustration 
and dissatisfaction, not only with the administrators of the 
sanitation department, but with all the representatives of local 

284 


government. This is particularly true with respect to the police, 
who are the only public agents on duty in the ghetto 24 hours 
a day and who bear this burden of hostility for the less visible 
elements of the system. 

The lack of communication and the absence of regular con- 
tacts with ghetto residents prevent city leaders fi;om learning 
about problems and grievances as they develop. As a result, 
tensions which could have been dissipated if responded to 
promptly, mount unnecessarily and the potential for explosion 
grows inevitably. Once disorder erupts, public officials are fre- 
quently unable to fashion an effective response; they lack 
adequate information about the nature of the trouble and its 
causes and they lack rapport with local leaders who might be 
able to influence the community. 

Second, many city governments are poorly organized to re- 
spond effectively to the needs of ghetto residents, even when 
these needs are made known to appropriate public officials. 
Most middle-class city dwellers have limited contacts with 
local government. When contacts do occur they tend to con- 
cern relatively narrow and specific problems. Furthermore, 
middle-class citizens, although subject to many of the same 
frustrations and resentments in dealing with the public 
bureaucracy as ghetto residents, find it relatively easy to lo- 
cate the appropriate agency for help and redress. If they fail 
to get satisfaction, they can call on a variety of remedies — 
assistance of elected representatives, friends in government, a 
lawyer. In short, the middle-class city dweller has relatively 
fewer needs for public services and is reasonably well posi- 
tioned to move the system to his benefit. 

On the other hand, the typical ghetto resident has inter- 
related social and economic problems which require the 
services of several government and private agencies. At the 
same time, he may be unable to identify his problems to fit the 
complicated structure of government. Moreover, he may be 
unaware of his rights and opportunities under public programs 
and unable to obtain the necessary guidance from either public 
or private sources. 

Current trends in municipal administration have had the 
effect of reducing the capacity of local government to respond 
effectively to these needs. The pressures for administrative 
efficiency and cost-cutting have brought about the withdrawal 
of many operations of city government from direct contact 
with neighborhood and citizen. Red tape and administrative 
complexity have filled the vacuum created by the centraliza- 
tion of local government. The introduction of a merit system 
and a professionalized civil service has made management of 

285 


the cities more businesslike, but it has also tended to deperson- 
alize and isolate government. The rigid patterns of segregation 
prevalent within the central city have widened the distance 
between Negro citizens and city hall. 

In most of the riot cities surveyed by the Commission, we 
found little or no meaningful coordination among city agencies 
either in responding to the needs of ghetto residents on an 
ongoing basis or in planning to head off disturbances. The 
consequences of this lack of coordination were particularly 
severe for the police. Despite the fact that they were being 
called upon increasingly to deal with tensions and citizen com- 
plaints having little, if anything, to do with police services, the 
police departments of many large cities were isolated from 
other city agencies, sometimes including the mayor and his 
staff. In these cities, the police were compelled to deal with 
ghetto residents angered over dirty streets, dilapidated hous- 
ing, unfair commercial practices or inferior schools — griev- 
ances which they had neither the responsibility for creating, 
nor the authority to redress. 

Third, ghetto residents increasingly believe that they are 
excluded from the decision-making process which affects their 
lives and community. This feeling of exclusion, intensified by 
the bitter legacy of racial discrimination, has engendered a 
deep seated hostility toward the institutions of government. It 
has severely compromised the effectiveness of programs in- 
tended to provide improved services to ghetto residents. 

In part, this is the lesson of Detroit and New Haven where 
well intentioned programs designed to respond to the needs 
of ghetto residents were not worked out and implemented 
sufficiently in cooperation with the intended beneficiaries. A 
report prepared for the Senate Subcommittee on Employment, 
Manpower and Poverty presented just prior to the riot in 
Detroit, found that: 

Area residents . . . complain almost continually that . . . their de- 
mands for program changes are not heeded, that they have little 
voice in what goes on. ... As much as the area residents are 
involved, listened to, and even heeded, ... it becomes fairly 
clear that the relationship is still one of superordinate-subordi- 
nate, rather than one of equals . . . the procedures by which 
HRD (the Mayor's Committee for Human Resources Develop- 
ment, the Detroit Community Action Agency) operates by and 
large admit the contributions of area residents only after pro- 
grams have been written, after policies have already operated 
for a time or already been formulated, and to a large degree, 
only in formal and infrequent meetings rather than in day-to- 
day operations. . . . The meaningfulness of resident involvement 

286 


is reduced by its after-the-fact nature and by relatively limited 
resources they have at their disposal.1 

Mayor Alfonso J. Cervantes of St. Louis was even more 
explicit. In testimony before this Commission, he stated that: 

We have found that ghetto neighborhoods cannot be operated 
on from outside alone. The people within them should have a 
voice, and our experience has shown that it is often a voice that 
speaks with good sense, since the practical aspect of the needs 
of the ghetto people are so much clearer to the people there 
than they are to anyone else. 

The political system, traditionally an important vehicle for 
minorities to participate effectively in decisions affecting the 
distribution of public resources, has not worked for the Negro 
as it has for other groups. The reasons are fairly obvious. 

We have found that the number of Negro officials in elected 
and appointed positions in the riot cities is minimal in propor- 
tion to the Negro population. The alienation of the Negro from 
the political process has been exacerbated by his racial and 
economic isolation. 

Specifically, the needs of ghetto residents for social welfare 
and other public services have swelled dramatically at a time 
when increased affluence has diminished the need for such 
services by the rest of the urban population. By reducing dis- 
proportionately the economic disability of other portions of the 
population, particularly other ethnic urban minorities, this 
affluence has left the urban Negro few potential local allies 
with whom to make common cause for shared objectives. The 
development of political alliances, essential to effective partici- 
pation of minority groups in the political process, has been 
further impaired by the polarization of the races, which on 
both sides has transformed economic considerations into 
racial issues. 

Finally, these developments have coincided with the demise 
of the historic urban political machines and the growth of the 
"city manager" concept of government. While this tendency 
has produced major benefits in terms of honest and efficient 
administration, it has eliminated an important political link 
between city government and low-income residents. 

These conditions have produced a vast and threatening 
disparity in perceptions of the intensity and validity of Negro 
dissatisfaction. Viewed from the perspective of the ghetto resi-

287 


dent, city government appears distant and unconcerned, the 
possibility of effective change remote. As a result, tension rises 
perceptibly; the explosion comes as the climax to a progress 
sion of tension-generating incidents. To the city administration, 
unaware of this growing tension or unable to respond effec- 
tively to it, the outbreak of disorder comes as a shock. 

No democratic society can long endure the existence within 
its major urban centers of a substantial number of citizens who 
feel deeply aggrieved as a group, yet lack confidence in the 
government to rectify perceived injustice and in their ability 
to bring about needed change. 

We are aware that reforms in existing instruments of local 
government and their relationship to the ghetto population will 
mean little unless joined with sincere and comprehensive re- 
sponse to the severe social and economic needs of ghetto 
residents. Elsewhere in this Report we make specific recom- 
mendations with respect to employment, education, welfare, 
and housing which we hope will meet some of these needs. 

We believe, however, that there are measures which can and 
should be taken now; that they can be put to work without 
great cost and without delay; that they can be built upon in the 
future and that they will effectively reduce the level of griev- 
ance and tension as well as improve the responsiveness of local 
government to the needs of ghetto residents. 

BASIC STRATEGY AND GOALS 

To meet the needs identified above, we recommend pursuit 
of a comprehensive strategy, which would accomplish the 
following goals: 

• Effective  communication  between  ghetto  residents  and local 
government. 

Improved ability of local government to respond to the needs 
and problems of ghetto residents. , . . 

• Expanded opportunities for indigenous leadership to participate 
in shaping decisions and policies which affect their community. 

• Increased accountability of public officials. 

We recognize that not all of the programs proposed below 
to implement the foregoing goals can be instituted with the 
immediacy which the problem requires. Because the need for 
action at the local level, where government impinges directly 
upon the ghetto resident, is particularly urgent, we propose that 
our suggested programs be implemented in two phases. It is 
vital, however, that the first phase programs not be regarded or 
perceived as short term, and anti-riot efforts calculated to cool 
already inflamed situations. These programs will have little 

288 


• 


chance of succeeding unless they are part of a long-range 
commitment to action designed to eliminate the fundamental 
sources of grievance and tension. 

programs: first phase actions 

Establishment of Neighborhood Action Task Forces 

To open channels of communication between government 
and ghetto residents, improve the capacity of the city admin- 
istration to respond effectively to community needs and pro- 
vide opportunity for meaningful citizen participation in 
decision-making, we recommend establishment of joint 
government-community Neighborhood Action Task Forces 
covering each neighborhood within the city which has a high 
proportion of low-income minority citizens. While the exact 
form of these groups will depend upon the size and needs of 
each municipality, the following basic features should be 
incorporated: 

Composition: Each Task Force should include a key official 
in the mayor's office with direct and immediate access to the 
mayor, ranking city officials from the operating agencies serv- 
icing the ghetto community, elected leaders, representatives 
from the local business, labor, professional and church com- 
munities and neighborhood leaders, including representatives 
of community organizations of all orientations and youth lead- 
ers. Each Task Force would be headed by the mayor's repre- 
sentative. In the larger cities, each of these chairmen would sit 
as a member of a city-wide Task Force. 

Functions: The Neighborhood Action Task Forces should 
meet on a regular basis at a location accessible to ghetto resi- 
dents. These meetings will afford an opportunity for ghetto 
leaders to communicate directly with the municipal adminis- 
trators for their area to discuss problems and programs which 
affect the community. In effect, this device furnishes an inter- 
agency coordinating mechanism on the one hand and a 
"community cabinet" on the other. 

Ghetto residents should be able to rely on the capacity of the 
Task Force to cut through the maze of red tape and to over- 
come bureaucratic barriers in order to make things — collection 
of garbage, removal of abandoned cars, installation of lights in 
the park, establishment of playstreets — happen. To accomplish 
this purpose, the participating city officials should be those 
with operational decision-making authority. Lower-staff or 
public relations personnel will not be able to provide the con- 
frontation and interaction with the community representatives 
which is essential to the effective functioning of the Task 

289 


Force. Moreover, there is grave danger that opening channels 
of communication without providing opportunities for obtain- 
ing relief will further estrange ghetto residents. If this is not 
to happen, the Task Force should have a meaningful and 
realistic capacity for securing redress of grievances. For the 
same reason, it is essential that the Task Force have the full 
and energetic support of the mayor and the city council. 

The potential for responding effectively to community needs 
is not limited to available public resources. Acting through 
business, labor and church members and local Urban Coali- 
tions which have already been formed, the Task Force will 
have a capacity to involve the resources of the private sector 
in meeting needs within the ghetto. Possibilities range from 
support of special summer youth programs (weekend trips, 
recreation events, camping programs) to provision of cultural 
and employment opportunities on a year-round basis. 

The Neighborhood Action Task Force can play a significant 
role with respect to youth activities. One approach which has 
worked in several cities involves the establishment of Youth 
Councils to employ young street leaders (regardless of previ- 
ous police records) to develop community programs for other 
alienated youth. These activities might include organizing and 
operating libraries, neighborhood cleanup campaigns, police- 
community dialogues and sports competitions in their own 
neighborhoods. 

Finally, such an organization can make a major contribution 
to the prevention of civil disorders. If the Task Force has been 
successful in achieving the objectives stressed above, its mem- 
bers will have gained the confidence of a wide spectrum of 
ghetto residents. This will enable them to identify potentially 
explosive conditions and, working with the police, to defuse 
them. 

Similarly, the Task Force could have considerable effective- 
ness in handling threatening incidents identified by the police. 
To accomplish this objective, an early warning system could 
be instituted during the critical summer months. Operating on 
a 24-hour basis, such a system would have the capacity to 
receive and evaluate police reports of potentially serious inci- 
dents and to initiate an appropriate non-police response, 
utilizing community contacts and Task Force personnel. Any 
such operation must have the cooperation of the police, who 
will be in control of the overall disorder response. To avoid 
confusion and duplication of effort, the Task Force should 
have responsibility for coordinating the efforts of all agencies, 
other than police and fire, once a disturbance has occurred. 
An example will serve to illustrate how such a system might 
operate. 

290 


Following the slaying last summer of a Negro teen-ager by 
a Negro detective in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brook- 
lyn, New York, a rumor that the youth had been shot by a 
white policeman and that the police were trying to suppress 
this information began to circulate through an already tense 
neighborhood. The situation became threatening. Yet, within 
an hour, three white members of the mayor's summer task 
force group were able to convince a group of black militants 
that the police version was true. Walking the streets that night 
and the next two evenings, they worked to dispel the rumor 
and to restore community stability. 

In the larger cities, the city-wide task force could have 
responsibility for coordinating the programs of various munici- 
pal agencies, concentrating their impact on poverty areas and 
planning for the more effective implementation of existing 
public efforts. 

The Commission believes that the Task Force approach can 
do precisely what other forms of neighborhood organizations 
have not been able to do. It can connect the real needs and 
priorities of low-income residents with the energies and re- 
sources of both city government and the private sector. It can 
substantially improve the quality and timeliness of city services 
to these areas. It will fail unless all of the groups involved are 
prepared to deal fairly and openly with the problems of the 
community. But if it succeeds, it will not only produce im- 
proved services but help to generate a new sense of community, 
as well. 

Establishment of Effective Grievance-Response Mechanisms 

Effective implementation of the Neighborhood Action Task 
Forces will depend upon the continuing commitment of the 
city administration to its success. To ensure continuous atten- 
tion to many of the sources of tension identified above, we 
recommend that formal mechanisms for the processing of 
grievances, many of which will relate to the performance of 
the city government, be established independent of the local 
administration. 

We are convinced, on the record before this Commission, 
that the frustration reflected in the recent disorders results, in 
part at least, from the lack of accessible and visible means of 
establishing the merits of grievances against the agencies of 
local and state government, including but not limited to the 
police. Cities and states throughout the country now have 
under consideration various forms of grievance-response 
devices. While we are not prepared to specify the form which 
such a mechanism should take in any particular community, 

291 


there are certain criteria which should be met. These include: 

• Independence: This can be achieved by long term appointment 
of the administrator, subject to City Council removal. The 
grievance agency should be separate from operating municipal 
agencies. 

• Adequate staff and funding: Exact costs will vary depending on 
the size and needs of the city's population. It is most important 
that the agency have adequate funds and staff to discharge its 
responsibilities. 

• Comprehensive coverage of grievances against public agencies 
and authorities: General jurisdiction will facilitate access by 
grievants. Moreover, unlike specialized, complaint agencies, such 
as civilian review boards, all agencies would be brought equally 
under public scrutiny. This should facilitate its acceptance by 
public officials. 

• Power to receive complaints, hold hearings, subpoena witnesses, 
make public recommendation? for remedial action to local au- 
thorities and, in cases involving violation of law, bring suit. 
These powers are the minimum necessary to the effective opera- 
tion of the grievance mechanism. As we envision it, the agency's 
principal power derives from its authority to investigate and 
make public findings and recommendations. It should, of course, 
have a conciliation process whereby complaints could be re- 
solved without full investigation and processing. 

• Accessibility: In large cities, ready access to grievants may re- 
quire setting up neighborhood offices in ghetto areas. In others, 
local resident aides could be empowered to receive complaints. 
It should be possible to file a grievance orally or in writing. If 
forms are used, they should be easily understood and widely 
available. 

• Participation in grievance process: Grievants should be given 
full opportunity to take part in all proceedings and to be repre- 
sented by counsel. They should receive prompt advice of action 
taken, and results of investigations should be made public 

Expanded Legal Services 

Among the most intense grievances underlying the riots of 
the summer of 1967 were those which derived from conflicts 
between ghetto residents and private parties, principally the 
white landlord and merchant. Though the legal obstacles are 
considerable, resourceful and imaginative use of available 
legal processes could contribute significantly to the alleviation 
of resulting tensions. Through the adversary process which is 
at the heart of our judicial system, litigants are afforded mean- 
ingful opportunity to influence events which affect them and 
their community. However, effective utilization of the courts 
requires legal assistance, a resource seldom available to the 
poor. 

Litigation is not the only need which ghetto residents have 
for legal service. Participation in the grievance procedures 
suggested above may well require legal assistance. More im- 

292 


portantly, ghetto residents have need of effective advocacy of 
their interests and concerns in a variety of other contexts, from 
representation before welfare agencies and other institutions 
of government to advocacy before planning boards and com- 
missions concerned with the formulation of development plans. 
Again, professional representation can provide substantial 
benefits in terms of overcoming the ghetto resident's aliena- 
tion from the institutions of government by implicating him 
in its processes. Although lawyers function in precisely this 
fashion for the middle-class clients, they are too often not 
available to the impoverished ghetto resident. 

The Legal Services Program administered by the Office of 
Economic Opportunity has made a good beginning in provid- 
ing legal assistance to the poor. Its present level of effort should 
be substantially expanded through increased private and public 
funding. In addition, the participation of law schools should be 
increased through development of programs whereby ad- 
vanced students can provide legal assistance as a regular part 
of their professional training. In all of these efforts, the local 
bar bears major responsibility for leadership and support. 

Assistance for Mayors and City Councils 

In the chapters that follow we direct attention to broad 
strategies and programs of national action. Yet the capacity of 
the Federal Government to affect local problems depends to a 
great extent on the capacity of city government to respond 
competently to federal program initiatives. 

In the face of the bewildering proliferation of both com- 
munity demands and local, state and federal programs, mayors 
and city councils need to create new mechanisms to aid in 
decision making, program planning and coordination. At this 
time, however, no assistance is available to develop these new 
and critically necessary institutional capabilities or to support 
the required research, consultants, staff or other vital com- 
ponents of administrative or legislative competence. 

The Commission recommends, therefore, that both the state 
and federal governments provide financial assistance to cities 
for these purposes as a regular part of all urban program 
funding. 

Hearings on Ghetto Problems and Enactment of 
Appropriate Local Legislation 

Many of the grievances identified in our study of the condi- 
tions underlying civil disorders can be redressed only through 
legislative action. Accordingly, we recommend that the legisla- 

293 


tive body of each city with a substantial minority population 
hold, as soon as possible, a series of hearings on ghetto prob- 
lems. In large cities, these hearings could well be held in the 
ghetto itself to facilitate full citizen participation. 

In addition to establishing a foundation for needed legisla- 
tive measures, these hearings would constitute a visible demon- 
stration of governmental concern for the problems of ghetto 
residents. They would also provide a most useful means of 
bridging the communications gap, contributing to an improved 
understanding in the white community about the conditions of 
ghetto life. 

Expanded Employment by City Government of 
Ghetto Residents 

We strongly recommend that local government undertake a 
concerted effort to provide substantial employment opportu- 
nities for ghetto residents. Local governments now employ 6.4 
million people full-time, most of whom live in urban areas; 
they comprise one of the fastest growing segments of the 
economy. This offers an opportunity of the greatest significance 
for local government to respond to one of the most critical 
needs of ghetto residents and, at the same time, to decrease the 
distance between city hall and the ghetto by deliberate employ- 
ment, training and upgrading of Negroes. 

To accomplish this goal, we recommend that municipal 
authorities review applicable civil service policies and job 
standards and take prompt action to remove arbitrary barriers 
to employment of ghetto residents. Re-evaluation is particu- 
larly necessary with respect to requirements relating to em- 
ployment qualification tests and police records. Leadership by 
city government in this vital area is of urgent priority, not only 
because of the important public employment potential, but also 
to stimulate private employers to take similar action. 

SECOND  PHASE  ACTIONS 

Establishment of Neighborhood City Halls 

The Neighborhood Action Task Force concept provides a 
basis on which lasting structures can be erected. The principal 
change required in order to transform the official component 
of the Task Force into a permanent instrument of local govern- 
ment involves the establishment of offices in the neighborhoods 
served. Depending on the size and composition of the neigh- 
borhood, the permanent staff should include an assistant 
mayor, representatives of the municipal agencies, the city 

294 


councilman's staff and other institutions and groups included 
in the Task Force. This facility would function, in effect, as a 
"Neighborhood City Hall." 

The Neighborhood City Hall would accomplish several 
interrelated objectives. It would contribute to the improvement 
of public services by providing an effective channel for low- 
income citizens to communicate their needs and problems to 
the appropriate public officials and by increasing the ability of 
local government to respond in a coordinated and timely 
fashion. It would serve as the eyes and ears of the mayor and 
council and furnish an informal forum for complaints and 
grievances. It would make information about government 
programs and services available to ghetto residents, enabling 
them to make more effective use of such programs and services 
and making clear the limitations on the availability of all such 
programs and services. It would expand opportunities for 
meaningful community access to and involvement in the plan- 
ning and implementation of policy affecting the neighbor- 
hood. Most important, the Neighborhood City Hall, building 
on the Task Force approach, affords a significant opportunity 
to accomplish the democratic goal of making government 
closer and more accountable to the citizen. 

Development of Multi-Service Centers 

Frequently, services vital to the ghetto resident — job place- 
ment and location, health care, legal assistance — are inaccessi- 
ble because they are located at considerable distance from the 
ghetto, a distance often made greater by the lack of efficient 
public transportation. This problem is compounded by the 
fact that many key service institutions are fragmented, requir- 
ing those seeking assistance to pursue it at various locations 
scattered throughout a large urban area. 

To meet this need, the Office of Economic Opportunity has 
funded over 700 neighborhood centers in ghetto areas through- 
out the country since 1964. Many of these have been small 
store-front operations housing OEO-funded services. Some, as 
in Detroit, have had a fairly wide range of services and have 
served a large number of families. 

The principal problem has been that most centers have not 
been comprehensive enough. They rarely include traditional 
city and state agency services. Many relevant federal programs 
are seldom located in the same center. Manpower and educa- 
tion programs from HEW and the Labor Department, for 
example, have been housed in separate centers without ade- 
quate consolidation or coordination either geographically or 
programmatically. 

295 


The resulting proliferation led the President to call upon the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development to establish 
comprehensive "one stop service centers." The experience thus 
far indicates the need for more effective coordination of fed- 
eral programs at the national and regional levels. Legislation 
may be required to simplify grant procedures and assure such 
coordination. 

Each center should have enough neighborhood workers to 
reach out into the homes of needy people who are not able to 
seek help. To assure that the service centers are relevant to the 
needs and styles of the neighborhood, ghetto residents should 
be trained and employed at all levels. This purpose can well be 
served through establishment and involvement of Community 
Service Center Councils to establish overall policy. 

We recommend increased federal funding for comprehen- 
sive centers and implementation of the policy guidelines 
proposed above. 

Improved Political Representation 

It is beyond the scope of this Report to consider in detail the 
many problems presented by the existing distribution of polit- 
ical power within city governments. But it is plain that the 
Negro ghetto resident feels deeply that he is not represented 
fairly and adequately under the arrangements which prevail in 
many cities. This condition strikes at major democratic values. 

To meet this problem, city government and the majority 
community should revitalize the political system to encourage 
fuller participation by all segments of the community. Whether 
this requires adoption of any one system of representation, we 
are not prepared to say. But it is clear that at-large representa- 
tion, currently the practice in many American cities, does not 
give members of the minority community a feeling of involve- 
ment or stake in city government. Further, this form of repre- 
sentation dilutes the normal political impact of pressures 
generated by a particular neighborhood or district. 

Negro representation and participation in the formal struc- 
ture of government can also be furthered by a concerted effort 
to appoint Negroes to significant policy positions in city 
government. 

More Effective Community Participation 

One of the most difficult and controversial problems we have 
encountered relates to ghetto demands for "self-determination" 
or "community control." To a limited extent, this concept was 
made a matter of national policy in the Economic Opportunity 

296 


Act of 1964 which specified that community action programs 
should be developed, conducted and administered with "maxi- 
mum feasible participation" of the residents of the areas and 
members of the groups served. 

In the three years since the beginning of the war on poverty, 
the effort to put maximum feasible participation into effect 
has met with both success and failure. One measure of its 
success can be seen in the extent to which the demand for 
participation, even control, over a variety of programs affect- 
ing the ghetto has spilled over into the most traditional areas, 
such as public school administration. 

But the demands made often seem intransigent and the time 
required for negotiation with residents extravagant. The pull- 
ing and hauling of different factions competing for control 
within the ghetto community sometimes makes it difficult to 
mount any program. Moreover, it is often easier to organize 
groups to oppose, complain, demonstrate and boycott than to 
develop and run programs. 

Yet, the demand for a community voice represents a marked 
and desirable gain over the apathy that existed before. Despite 
its problems, we believe that meaningful community participa- 
tion and a substantial measure of involvement in program 
development is an essential strategy for city government. The 
democratic values which it advances — providing a stake in the 
social system, improving the accountability of public officials — 
as well as the pragmatic benefits which it provides far outweigh 
these costs. 

The essential question which city leadership must face is the 
ultimate goal of community participation. In this sense, com- 
munity involvement is directly related to the strategy of decen- 
tralization, for with the support of the city, neighborhood 
groups may become an effective force for carrying on a variety 
of functions — such as physical renewal and redevelopment — 
which can be highly disruptive when imposed by outside 
authority. 

If these principles are accomplished, then the choice of 
mechanisms will depend upon the needs of the particular 
community and the structure of the local government. We have 
described earlier in this section opportunities for meaningful 
community participation in the processes of government. Addi- 
tional and diverse instrumentalities such as community neigh- 
borhood school boards, community planning boards, tenants' 
councils, youth councils, advisory committees and consumer 
trade organizations offer further ways of providing institutional 
channels for effective citizen participation in public decision- 
making. The crucial issue, however, is whether city government 
is willing to legitimate these organizations by dealing with them 

297 


on a regular basis with respect to matters within their compe- 
tence. We believe that such an approach offers substantial 
promise of improving the relationship between local govern- 
ment and ghetto residents. 

The involvement of the ghetto community in the planning 
and operation of development programs need not be confined 
to the public arena. There is great potential in private commu- 
nity development corporations which can emerge from a com- 
bined public-private sponsorship and perform mixed functions 
for the community, including sponsorship of locally owned 
businesses. 

A most promising approach is the neighborhood member- 
ship corporation, the first of which was established in Colum- 
bus, Ohio, in 1965 — the East Central Citizens Organization 
(ECCO), under an OEO grant. Functioning as a town meet- 
ing, its members include all of the residents of a defined ghetto 
neighborhood (8,150 people). Its activities encompass day- 
care centers, credit unions, legal and medical services, news- 
papers, restaurants and business enterprises. 

Both money and manpower will be needed from govern- 
ment, foundations and private business to create and assist 
these corporations and other new community institutions. 
Technical and professional support will be required. The 
opportunity that they offer to develop stable community lead- 
ership structures and constructive involvement should not be 
allowed to fail for lack of such support. 

CONCLUSION 

Finally, there remains the issue of leadership. Now, as never 
before, the American city has need for the personal qualities of 
strong democratic leadership. Given the difficulties and delays 
involved in administrative reorganization or institutional 
change, the best hope for the city in the short run lies in this 
powerful instrument. In most cities the mayor will have the 
prime responsibility. 

It is in large part his role now to create a sense of commit- 
ment and concern for the problems of the ghetto community 
and to set the tone for the entire relationship between the insti- 
tutions of city government and all the citizenry. 

Part of the task is to interpret the problems of the ghetto 
community to the citizenry at large and to generate channels 
of communication between Negro and white leadership outside 
of government. Only if all the institutions of the community — 
those outside of government as well as those inside the structure 
— are implicated in the problems of the ghetto, can the aliena- 
tion and distrust of disadvantaged citizens be overcome. 

298 


This is now the decisive role for the urban mayor. As leader 
and mediator, he must involve all those groups — employers, 
news media, unions, financial institutions and others — which 
only together can bridge the chasm now separating the racial 
ghetto from the community- His goal, in effect, must be to 
develop a new working concept of democracy within the city. 

In this effort, state government has a vital role to play. It 
must equip city leadership with the jurisdictional tools to deal 
with its problems. It must provide a fuller measure of financial 
and other resources to urban areas. Most importantly, state 
leadership is in a unique position to focus the interests and 
growing resources, political as well as financial, of the suburbs 
on the physical, social, and cultural environment of the central 
cities. The crisis confronting city government today cannot be 
met without regional cooperation. This cooperation can take 
many forms — metropolitan government, regional planning, 
joint endeavors. It must be a principal goal, perhaps the over- 
riding concern, of leadership at the state level to fashion a 
lasting and mutually productive relationship between city and 
suburban areas. 


Chapter 11 / Police and the Community 

Introduction 

We have cited deep hostility between police and ghetto 
communities as a primary cause of the disorders surveyed 
by the Commission. In Newark, in Detroit, in Watts, in Har- 
lem— in practically every city that has experienced racial dis- 
ruption since the summer of 1964 — abrasive relationships 
between police and Negroes and other minority groups have 
been a major source of grievance, tension and, ultimately, 
disorder. 

In a fundamental sense, however, it is wrong to define the 
problem solely as hostility to police. In many ways the police- 
man only symbolizes much deeper problems. 

The policeman in the ghetto is a symbol not only of law, 
but of the entire system of law enforcement and criminal 
justice. 

As such, he becomes the tangible target for grievances 
against shortcomings throughout that system: against assem- 
bly-line justice in teeming lower courts; against wide dispari- 
ties in sentences; against antiquated corrections facilities; 
against the basic inequities imposed by the system on the poor 
— to whom, for example, the option of bail means only jail. 

The policeman in the ghetto is a symbol of increasingly 
bitter social debate over law enforcement. 

299 


One side, disturbed and perplexed by sharp rises in crime 
and urban violence, exerts extreme pressure on police for 
tougher law enforcement. Another group, inflamed against 
police as agents of repression, tends toward defiance of what 
it regards as order maintained at the expense of justice. 

The policeman in the ghetto is the most visible symbol, 
finally, of a society from which many ghetto Negroes are 
increasingly alienated. 

At the same time, police responsibilities in the ghetto are 
even greater than elsewhere in the community since the other 
institutions of social control have so little authority: the 
schools, because so many are segregated, old, and inferior; 
religion, which has become irrelevant to those who have lost 
faith as they lost hope; career aspirations, which for many 
young Negroes are totally lacking; the family, because its 
bonds are so often snapped. It is the policeman who must 
deal with the consequences of this institutional vacuum and is 
then resented for the presence and the measures this effort 
demands. 

Alone, the policeman in the ghetto cannot solve these prob- 
lems. His role is already one of the most difficult in our so- 
ciety. He must deal daily with a range of problems and people 
that test his patience, ingenuity, character, and courage in 
ways that few of us are ever tested. Without positive leadership, 
goals, operational guidance, and public support, the individual 
policeman can only feel victimized. Nor are these problems 
the responsibility only of police administrators; they are deep 
enough to *ax the courage, intelligence, and leadership of 
mayors, city officials, and community leaders. As Dr. Kenneth 
B. Clark told the Commission: 

This society knows . . . that if human beings are confined in 
ghetto compounds of our cities, and are subjected to criminally 
inferior education, pervasive economic and job discrimination, 
committed to houses unfit for human habitation, subjected to 
unspeakable conditions of municipal services, such as sanita- 
tion, that such human beings are not likely to be responsive to 
appeals to be lawful, to be respectful, to be concerned with 
property of others. 

And yet, precisely because the policeman in the ghetto is a 
symbol — precisely because he symbolizes so much — it is of 
critical importance that the police and society take every pos- 
sible step to allay grievances that flow from a sense of injustice 
and increased tension and turmoil. 

In this work, the police bear a major responsibility for 
making needed changes. In the first instance, they have the 
prime responsibility for safeguarding the minimum goal of 
any civilized society — security of life and property. To do so, 

300 


they are given society's maximum power — discretion in the 
use of force. Second, it is axiomatic that effective law en- 
forcement requires the support of the community. Such sup- 
port will not be present when a substantial segment of the 
community feels threatened by the police and regards the 
police as an occupying force. 

At the same time, public officials also have a clear duty 
to help the police make any necessary changes to minimize 
so far as possible the risk of further disorders. 

We see five basic problem areas: 

• The need for change in police operation in the ghetto to ensure 
proper conduct by individual officers and to eliminate abrasive 
practices. 

• The need for more adequate police protection of ghetto resi- 
dents to eliminate the present high sense of insecurity to person 
and property. 

• The need for effective mechanisms for resolving citizen griev- 
ances against the police. 

• The need for policy guidelines to assist police in areas where 
police conduct can create tension. 

• The need to develop community support for law enforcement. 

Our discussion of each of these problem areas is followed 
by specific recommendations which relate directly to more 
effective law enforcement and to the prevention and control of 
civil disorders.1 

I. Police Conduct and Patrol Practices 

In an earlier era third-degree interrogations were wide- 
spread, indiscriminate arrests on suspicion were generally ac- 
cepted, and "alley justice" dispensed with the nightstick was 
common. 

Today, many disturbances studied by the Commission began 
with a police incident. But these incidents were not, for the 
most part, the crude acts of an earlier time. They were rou- 
tine police actions such as stopping a motorist or raiding 
an illegal business. Indeed, many of the serious disturbances 
took place in cities whose police are among the best led, best 
organized, best trained and most professional in the country. 

Yet some activities of even the most professional police 
department may heighten tension and enhance the potential 
for civil disorder. An increase in complaints of police mis- 

1 We wish to acknowledge our indebtedness to and reliance upon the exten- 
sive work done by the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and 
Administration of Justice (The "Crime Commission,,). The reports, studies, 
surveys, and analyses of the Crime Commission have contributed to many 
of our conclusions and recommendations. 

301 


conduct, for example, may in fact be a reflection of profes- 
sionalism; the department may simply be using law enforce- 
ment methods which increase the total volume of police 
contacts with the public. The number of charges of police 
misconduct may be greater simply because the volume of 
police-citizen contacts is higher. 

Here we examine two aspects of police activities that have 
great tension-creating potential. Our objective is to provide 
recommendations to assist city and police officials in develop- 
ing practices which can allay rather than contribute to tension. 

Police Conduct 

Negroes firmly believe that police brutality and harassment 
occur repeatedly in Negro neighborhoods. This belief is un- 
questionably one of the major reasons for intense Negro 
resentment against the police. 

The extent of this belief is suggested by attitude surveys. 
In 1964, a New York Times study of Harlem showed that 43 
percent of those questioned believed in the existence of police 
"brutality".2 In 1965, a nationwide Gallup Poll found that 35 
percent of Negro men believe there was police brutality in 
their areas; 7 percent of white men thought so. In 1966, a 
survey conducted for the Senate Subcommittee on Executive 
Reorganization found that 60 percent of Watts Negroes aged 
15 to 19 believed there was some police brutality. Half said 
they had witnessed such conduct. A University of California 
at Los Angeles study of the Watts area found that 79 percent 
of the Negro males believed police lack respect for or use 
insulting language to Negroes and 74 percent believed police 
use unnecessary force in making arrests. In 1967, an Urban 
League study of the Detroit riot area found that 82 percent 
believed there was some form of police brutality. 

The true extent of excessive and unjustified use of force 
is difficult to determine. One survey done for the Crime Com- 
mission suggests that when police-citizen contacts are system- 
atically observed, the vast majority are handled without 
antagonism or incident. Of 5,339 police-citizen contacts ob- 
served in slum precincts in three large cities, in the opinion 
of the observer, only 20 — about three-tenths of 1 percent — 
involved excessive or unnecessary force. And although almost 
all of those subjected to such force were poor, more than half 
were white. Verbal discourtesy was more common — 15 percent 
of all such contacts began with a "brusque or nasty command" 

2 The "brutality" referred to in this and other surveys is often not precisely 
defined, and covers conduct ranging from use of insulting language to exces- 
sive and unjustified use of force. 

302 


on the part of the officer. Again, however, the objects of such 
commands were more likely to be white than Negro. 

Such "observer" surveys may not fully reflect the normal 
pattern of police conduct. The Crime Commission Task Force 
concluded that although the study gave "no basis for stating 
the extent to which police officers used force, it did confirm 
that such conduct still exists in the cities where' observations 
were made." Our investigators confirm this conclusion. 

Physical abuse is only one source of aggravation in the 
ghetto. In nearly every city surveyed, the Commission heard 
complaints of harassment of interracial couples, dispersal 
of social street gatherings, and the stopping of Negroes on 
foot or in cars without obvious basis. These, together with 
contemptuous and degrading verbal abuse, have great impact 
in the ghetto. As one Commission witness said, these strip 
the Negro of the one thing that he may have left — his dignity, 
"the question of being a man." 

Some conduct — breaking up of street groups, indiscriminate 
stops and searches — is frequently directed at youths, creating 
special tensions in the ghetto where the average age is generally 
under 21. Ghetto youths, often without work and with homes 
that may be nearly uninhabitable, particularly in the summer, 
commonly spend much time on the street. Characteristically, 
they are not only hostile to police, but eager to demonstrate 
their own masculinity and courage. The police, therefore, are 
often subject to taunts and provocations, testing their self- 
control and, probably, for some, reinforcing their hostility to 
Negroes in general. Because youths commit a large and in- 
creasing proportion of crime, police are under growing pres- 
sure from their supervisors — and from the community — to deal 
with them forcefully. "Harassment of youths" may therefore 
be viewed by some police departments — and members even of 
the Negro community — as a proper crime prevention technique. 

In a number of cities the Commission heard complaints of 
abuse from Negro adults of all social and economic classes. 
Particular resentment is aroused by harassing Negro men in 
the company of white women — often their light-skinned Negro 
wives. 

"Harassment" or discourtesy may not be the result of mali- 
cious or discriminatory intent of police officers. Many officers 
simply fail to understand the effects of their actions because 
of their limited knowledge of the Negro community. Calling a 
Negro teenager by his first name may arouse resentment be- 
cause many whites still refuse to extend to adult Negroes the 
courtesy of the title, "Mister." A patrolman may take the arm 
of a person he is leading to the police car. Negroes are more 

303 


likely to resent this than whites because the action implies that 
they are on the verge of flight and may degrade them in the 
eyes of friends or onlookers. 

In assessing the impact of .police misconduct we emphasize 
that the improper acts of a relatively few officers may create 
severe tensions between the department and the entire Negro 
community. Whatever the actual extent of such conduct, we 
concur in the Crime Commission's conclusion that: 

... all such behavior is obviously and totally reprehensible, 
and when it is directed against minority-group citizens it is par- 
ticularly likely to lead, for quite obvious reasons, to bitterness 
in the community. 

Police Patrol Practices 

Although police administrators may take steps to attempt 
to eliminate misconduct by individual police officers, many 
departments have adopted patrol practices which in the words 
of one commentator, have ". . . replaced harassment by indi- 
vidual patrolmen with harassment by entire departments." 

These practices, sometimes known as "aggressive preventive 
patrol," take a number of forms, but invariably they involve 
a large number of police-citizen contacts initiated by police 
rather than in response to a call for help or service. One such 
practice utilizes a roving task force which moves into high- 
crime districts without prior notice, and conducts intensive, 
often indiscriminate, street stops and searches. A number of 
obviously suspicious persons are stopped. But so also are 
persons whom the beat patrolman would know are respected 
members of the community. Such task forces are often delib- 
erately moved from place to place making it impossible for its 
members to know the people with whom they come in contact. 

In some cities aggressive patrol is not limited to special task 
forces. The beat patrolman himself is expected to participate 
and to file a minimum number of "stop-and-frisk" or field in- 
terrogation reports for each tour of duty. This pressure to pro- 
duce, or a lack of familiarity with the neighborhood and its 
people, may lead to widespread use of these techniques with- 
out adequate differentiation between genuinely suspicious be- 
havior, and behavior which is suspicious to a particular officer 
merely because it is unfamiliar. 

Police administrators, pressed by public concern about crime, 
have instituted such patrol practices often without weighing 
their tension-creating effects and the resulting relationship to 
civil disorder. 

Motorization of police is another aspect of patrol that has 

304 


affected law enforcement in the ghetto. The patrolman comes 
to see the city through a windshield and hear about it over a 
police radio. To him, the area increasingly comes to consist 
only of law breakers. To the ghetto resident, the policeman 
comes increasingly to be only an enforcer. 

Loss of contact between the police officer and the commu- 
nity he serves adversely affects law enforcement. If an officer 
has never met, does not know, and cannot understand the lan- 
guage and habits of the people in the area he patrols, he cannot 
do an effective police job. His ability to detect truly suspicious 
behavior is impaired. He deprives himself of important sources 
of information. He fails to know those persons with an "equity" 
in the community — homeowners, small businessmen, profes- 
sional men, persons who are anxious to support proper law en- 
forcement— and thus sacrifices the contributions they can make 
to maintaining community order. 

Recommendations 

Police misconduct — whether described as brutality, harass- 
ment, verbal abuse, or discourtesy — cannot be tolerated even 
if it is infrequent. It contributes directly to the risk of civil dis- 
order. It is inconsistent with the basic responsibility and func- 
tion of a police force in a democracy. Police departments must 
have rules prohibiting such misconduct and enforce them vigor- 
ously. Police commanders must be aware of what takes place 
in the field, and take firm steps to correct abuses. We consider 
this matter further in the section on policy guidelines. 

Elimination of misconduct also requires care in selecting 
police for ghetto areas, for there the police responsibility is 
particularly sensitive, demanding and often dangerous. The 
highest caliber of personnel is required if police are to overcome 
feelings within the ghetto community of inadequate protection 
and unfair, discriminatory treatment. Despite this need, data 
from Commission investigators and from the Crime Commis- 
sion disclose that often a department's worst, not its best, are 
assigned to minority group neighborhoods. As Professor Albert 
Reiss, Director of the Center for Research on Social Organiza- 
tion, University of Michigan, testified before the Commission: 

... I think we confront in modern urban police departments 
in large cities much of what we encounter in our schools, in 
these cities. The slum police precinct is like the slum school. 
It gets, with few exceptions, the worst in the system. 

Referring to extensive studies in one city,, Professor Reiss 
concluded: 

305 


In predominantly Negro precincts, over three-fourths of the 
white policemen expressed prejudice or highly prejudiced at- 
titudes towards Negroes. Only one percent of the officers ex- 
pressed attitudes which could be described as sympathetic to- 
wards Negroes. Indeed, close to one-half of all the police officers 
in predominantly Negro high crime rate areas showed extreme 
prejudice against Negroes. What do I mean by extreme racial 
prejudice? I mean that they describe Negroes in terms that are 
not people terms. They describe them in terms of the animal 
kingdom. . . . 

Although some prejudice was displayed in only eight percent 
of police-citizen encounters: 

The cost of such prejudiced behavior I suggest is much higher 
than my statistics suggest. Over a period of time, a substantial 
proportion of citizens, particularly in high crime rate areas, may 
experience at least one encounter with a police officer where 
prejudice is shown. 

To ensure assignment of well-qualified police to ghetto areas, 
the Commission recommends: 

• Officers with bad reputations among residents in minority areas 
should be immediately reassigned to other areas. This will serve 
the interests of both the police and the community. 

• Screening procedures should be developed to ensure that offi- 
cers with superior ability, sensitivity and the common sense 
necessary for enlightened law enforcement are assigned to mi- 
nority group areas. We believe that, with proper training in 
ghetto problems and conditions, and with proper standards for 
recruitment of new officers, in the long run, most policemen can 
meet these standards. 

• Incentives, such as bonuses or credits for promotion should be 
developed wherever necessary to attract outstanding officers for 
ghetto positions. 

The recommendations we have proposed are designed to help 
ensure proper police conduct in minority areas. Yet there is 
another facet of the problem: Negro perceptions of police mis- 
conduct. Even if those perceptions are exaggerated, they do 
exist. If outstanding officers are assigned to ghetto areas, if acts 
of misconduct, however infrequent, result in proper — and vis- 
ible— disciplinary action, and if these corrective practices are 
made part of known policy, we believe the community will soon 
learn to reject unfounded claims of misconduct. 

Problems stemming from police patrol cannot, perhaps, be 
so easily resolved. But there are two considerations which can 
help to allay such problems. The first consideration relates to 
law enforcement philosophy behind the use of techniques like 
aggressive patrol. Many police officials believe strongly that 
there are law enforcement gains from such techniques. How- 

306 


ever, these techniques can also have law enforcement liabilities. 
Their employment therefore should not be merely automatic, 
but the product of a deliberate balancing of pluses and minuses 
by command personnel. 

We know that advice of this sort is easier to give than to act 
on. The factors involved are difficult to weigh. Gains cannot 
be measured solely in the number of arrests. Losses in police 
protection cannot be accepted solely because of some vague 
gain in diminished community tension. The kind of thorough, 
objective assessment of patrol practices and search for innova- 
tion we need will require the best efforts of research and devel- 
opment units within police departments, augmented if neces- 
sary by outside research assistance. The Federal Government 
can also play a major role in funding and conducting such 
research. 

The second consideration concerning patrol is execution. 
There is more crime in the ghetto than in other areas. If the 
aggressive patrol clearly relates to the control of crime, the 
residents of the ghetto are likely to endorse the practice. What 
may arouse hostility is not the fact of aggressive patrol but its 
indiscriminate use so that it comes to be regarded not as crime 
control but as a new method of racial harassment. All patrol 
practices must be carefully reviewed to ensure they are properly 
carried out by individual officers. 

New patrol practices must be designed to increase the patrol- 
man's knowledge of the ghetto. Although motorized patrols 
are essential, means should be devised to get the patrolman out 
of the car and into the neighborhood and keeping him on the 
same beat long enough to get to know the people and under- 
stand the conditions. This will require training the patrolman 
to convince him of the desirability of such practices. There 
must be continuing administrative supervision. In practice as 
well as theory, all aspects of patrol must be lawful and con- 
form to policy guidelines. Unless carried out with courtesy 
and with understanding of the community, even the most 
enlightened patrol practices may degenerate into what residents 
will come to regard as harassment. Finally, this concept of patrol 
should be publicly explained so that ghetto residents understand 
it and know what to expect. 

II. The Problem of Police Protection 

The strength of ghetto feelings about hostile police conduct 
may even be exceeded by the conviction that ghetto neighbor- 
hoods are not given adequate police protection. 

This belief is founded on two basic types of complaint. The 
first is that the police maintain a much less rigorous standard 
of law enforcement in the ghetto, tolerating there illegal activi- 

307 


ties like drug addiction, prostitution and street violence that 
they would not tolerate elsewhere. The second is that police 
treat complaints and calls for help from Negro areas much less 
urgently than from white areas. These perceptions are wide- 
spread. As David Hardy, of the staff of The New York Daily 
News, testified: 

To put it simply, for decades little if any law enforcement has 
prevailed among Negroes in America, particularly those in the 
ghettos. If a black man kills another black man, the law is gen- 
erally enforced at its minimum. Violence of every type runs 
rampant in a ghetto. 

A Crime Commission study found that Negroes in Phila- 
delphia and San Diego are convinced that the police apply a 
different standard of law enforcement in the ghettos. Another 
Crime Commission study found that about one white person 
in two believes police provide very good protection in his com- 
munity; for Negroes, the figure is one in five. Other surveys 
have reported that Negroes in Harlem and South Central Los 
Angeles mention inadequate protection more often than bru- 
tality or harassment as a reason for their resentment toward 
the police. 

The report of a New Haven community group summarizes 
the complaints: 

The problem of the adequacy of current police protection ranked 
with "police misconduct" as the most serious sore points in 
police-community relations. . . . When calls for help are regis- 
tered, it is all too frequent that police respond too slowly or 
not at all. . . . When they do come, [they] arrive with many more 
men and cars than are necessary . . . brandishing guns and add- 
ing to the confusion.8 

There is evidence to suggest that the lack of protection does 
not necessarily result from different basic police attitudes but 
rather from a relative lack of police personnel for ghetto areas, 
considering the volume of calls for police. As a consequence, 
the police work according to priorities. Because of the need for 
attention to major crimes, little, if any, attention can be ac- 
corded to reports of a suspicious person, for example, or a 
noisy party, or a drunk. And attention even to major crimes 
may sometimes be routine or skeptical. 

Ghetto residents, however, see a dual standard of law en- 
forcement. Particularly because many work in other areas of 
the city and have seen the nature of police responsiveness there, 
they are keenly aware of the difference. They come to believe 

8 "In Search of Fair and Adequate Law Enforcement," Report of the Hill- 
Dwight Citizens Commission on Police Community Relations, June, 1967, pp. 
12-13. 

308 


that an assault on a white victim produces one reaction and 
an assault on a Negro quite another. The police, heavily en- 
gaged in the ghetto, might assert that they cannot cover serious 
offenses and minor complaints at the same time — that they can- 
not be two places at once. The ghetto resident, however, often 
concludes that the police respond neither to serious offenses 
nor to minor complaints. 

Recent studies have documented the inadequacies of police 
response in some ghetto areas. A Yale Law Journal study of 
Hartford, Connecticut, found that: 

[T]he residents of a large area in the center of the Negro ghetto 
are victims of over one-third of the daylight residential bur- 
glaries in the city. Yet during the daytime only one of Hartford's 
eighteen patrol cars and none of its eleven foot patrolmen is 
assigned to this area. Sections in the white part of town about 
the same size as the central ghetto area receive slightly more 
intensive daytime patrol even though the citizens in the ghetto 
area summon the police about six times as often because of 
criminal acts.4 

In a United States Commission on Civil Rights study, a review 
of police communications records in Cleveland disclosed that 
police took almost four times as long to respond to calls con- 
cerning robbery from the Negro district as for the district 
where response was next slowest. The response time for some 
other crimes was at least twice as long. 

The Commission recommends: 

• Police departments should have a clear and enforced policy that 
the standard of law enforcement in ghetto areas is the same as 
in other communities; complaints and appeals from the ghetto 
should be treated with the same urgency and importance as 
those from white neighborhoods. 

• Because a basic problem in furnishing protection to the ghetto 
is the shortage of manpower, police departments should review 
existing deployment of field personnel to ensure the most efficient 
use of manpower. The Police Task Force of the Crime Com- 
mission stressed the need "to distribute patrol officers in ac- 
cordance with the actual need for their presence." Communities 
may have to pay for more and better policing for the entire 
community as well as for the ghetto. 

In allocating manpower to the ghetto, enforcement emphasis 
should be given to crimes that threaten life and property. Stress 
on social gambling or loitering, when more serious crimes are 
neglected, not only diverts manpower but fosters distrust and 
tension in the ghetto community.

III. The Problem of Grievance Mechanisms 

A third source of Negro hostility to police is the almost totai 
lack of effective channels for redress of complaints against 
police conduct. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Plainfield, New 
Jersey, for example, ghetto residents complained that police re- 
ject complaints out of hand. In New Haven, a Negro citizens' 
group characterized a police review board as worthless. In 
Detroit, the Michigan Civil Rights Commission found that, 
despite well-intentioned leadership, no real sanctions are 
imposed on offending officers. In Newark, the mayor referred 
complaints to the FBI, which had very limited jurisdiction 
over them. In many of the cities surveyed by the Commission, 
Negro complaints focused on the continued presence in the 
ghetto of officers regarded as notorious for prejudice and 
brutality. 

The 1967 Report of the Civil Rights Commission also states 
that a major issue in the Negro community is inadequate inves- 
tigation of complaints against the police. It even reports threats 
of criminal actions designed to discourage complainants. A sur- 
vey for the Crime Commission found substantial evidence that 
policemen in some cities have little fear of punishment for 
using unnecessary force because they appear to have a degree 
of immunity from their departments. 

Recommendations 

Objective evaluation, analysis, and innovation on this subject 
are vitally necessary. Yet attention has been largely, and un- 
fortunately, diverted by protracted debate over the desirability 
of "civilian review boards." Research conducted by the Crime 
Commission and others shows that the benefits and liabilities 
of such boards have probably both been exaggerated. 

In the context of civil disorder, appearances and reality are 
of almost equal importance in the handling of citizen com- 
plaints against the police. It is not enough that there are ade- 
quate machinery and procedures for handling complaints; it 
is also necessary that citizens believe these procedures are 
adequate. Some citizens will never trust an agency against 
which they have a grievance. Some irresponsible citizens will 
attempt to provoke distrust of every agency. Hence some police 
administrators have been tempted to throw up their hands and 
do nothing on the ground that whatever they do will be mis- 
understood. These sentiments may be understandable but the 
police should appreciate that Negro citizens also want to throw 
up their hands. For they believe that the "police stick together," 

310 


that they will cover up for each other, that no officer ever 
receives more than token punishment for misconduct, and that 
even such expensive legal steps as false arrest or civil damage 
suits are foredoomed because "it is the officer's word against 
mine." 

We believe that an internal review board — in which the 
police department itself receives and acts on complaints — re- 
gardless of its efficiency and fairness, can rarely generate the 
necessary community confidence, or protect the police against 
unfounded charges. We also believe, as did the Crime Com- 
mission, that police should not be the only municipal agency 
subject to outside scrutiny and review. Incompetence and mis- 
treatment by any public servant should be equally subject to 
review by an independent agency. 

The Crime Commission Police Task Force reviewed the 
various external grievance procedures attempted or suggested 
in this country and abroad. Without attempting to recommend 
a specific procedure, our Commission believes that police de- 
partments should be subject to external review. We discussed 
this problem in Chapter 10, The Community Response. Here, 
we highlight what we believe to be the basic elements of an 
effective system. 

The Commission recommends: 

• Making a complaint should be easy. It should be possible to file 
a grievance without excessive formality. If forms are used, they 
should be easily available and their use explained in widely- 
distributed pamphlets. In large cities, it should not be necessary 
to go to a central headquarters office to file a complaint but it 
should also be possible to file a complaint at neighborhood loca- 
tions. Police officers on the beat, community service aides, or 
other municipal employees in the community, should be empow- 
ered to receive complaints. 

• A specialized agency, with adequate funds and staff, should be 
created separate from other municipal agencies, to handle, in- 
vestigate and to make recommendations on citizen complaints. 

• The procedure should have a built-in conciliation process to at- 
tempt to resolve complaints without the need for full investiga- 
tion and processing. 

• The complaining party should be able to participate in the in- 
vestigation and in any hearings, with right of representation by 
counsel, so that the complaint is fully investigated and findings 
made on the merits. He should be promptly and fully informed 
of the outcome. The results of the investigation should be made 
public. 

• Since many citizen complaints concern departmental policies 
rather than individual conduct, information concerning com- 
plaints of this sort should be forwarded to the departmental unit 
which formulates or reviews policy and procedures. Informa- 
tion concerning all complaints should be forwarded to appro- 

311 


priate training units so that any deficiencies correctable by 
training can be eliminated. 

Although we advocate an external agency as a means of 
resolving grievances, we believe that the basic need is to adopt 
procedures which will gain the respect and confidence of the 
entire community. This need can, in the end, be met only by 
sustained direction through the line of command, thorough in- 
vestigation of complaints, and prompt, visible disciplinary 
action where justified. 

IV. The Need for Policy Guidelines 

How a policeman handles day-to-day contacts with citizens 
will, to a large extent, shape the relationships between the 
police and the community. These contacts involve considerable 
discretion. Improper exercise of such discretion can needlessly 
create tension and contribute to community grievances. 

Formally, the police officer has no discretion; his task is to 
enforce all laws at all times. Formally, the officer's only basic 
enforcement option is to make an arrest, or to do nothing. 
Formally, when a citizen resists arrest the officer's only re- 
course is to apply such reasonable force as he can bring with 
his hands, nightstick, and revolver. 

Informally — and in reality — the officer faces an entirely 
different situation. He has and must have a great deal of dis- 
cretion; there are not enough police or jails to permit the 
levels of surveillance that would be necessary to enforce all 
laws all the time — levels which the public would, in any event, 
regard as intolerable. 

Patrick V. Murphy, now Director of Public Safety in the 
District of Columbia, told the Commission: 

The police, of course, exercise very broad discretion, and 
although in many states the law says or implies that all laws 
must be enforced and although the manuals of many police 
departments state every officer is responsible for the enforce- 
ment of all laws, as a practical matter it is impossible for the 
police to enforce all laws, and as a result they exercise very 
broad discretion. . . . [B]y failing to understand the fact that 
they do exercise important discretion every day, some police do 
not perceive just how they maintain the peace in different ways 
in different sections of a city. 

The formal remedies of law, further, are inappropriate for 
many common problems. A family quarrel or a street fight, 
followed by an arrest, would give the parties a record and, 
typically, a suspended sentence; it would not solve the prob- 
lem. And the appropriate legal grounds for making an arrest 

312 


are often not present, for the officer has not witnessed the 
incident nor does he have a sworn complaint from someone 
who has. Pacifying the dispute may well be the best approach, 
but many officers lack the training or experience to do so 
effectively. If the parties resist pacification or arrest, the officer, 
alone on the street, must either back down oj: use force — 
sometimes lethal. 

Crime Commission studies and our police survey show that 
guidance for the exercise of discretion in many situations is 
often not available to the policeman. There are guidelines for 
the wearing of uniforms — but not for how to intervene in a 
domestic dispute; for the cleaning of a revolver — but not for 
when to fire it; for use of departmental property — but not for 
whether to break up a sidewalk gathering; for handling stray 
dogs — but not for handling field interrogations. 

Recommendations 

Contacts between citizens and the police in the ghetto 
require discretion and judgment which should be based upon 
carefully-drawn, written departmental policy. The Report of 
the Crime Commission and the Police Task Force Report con- 
sidered this problem in detail, and recommended subjects for 
policy guidelines. 

The Commission recommends the establishment of guide- 
lines covering, at a minimum: 

• The issuance of orders to citizens regarding their movements or 
activities — for example, when if ever should a policeman order 
a street gathering to break up or move on. 

• The handling of minor disputes — between husband and wife, 
merchant and customer, or landlord and tenant. Guidelines 
should cover resources available in the community — family 
courts, probation departments, counseling services, welfare 
agencies — to which citizens can be referred. 

• The decision whether to arrest in a specific situation involving a 
specific crime — for example, when police should arrest persons 
engaged in crimes such as social gambling, vagrancy and loiter- 
ing, and other crimes which do not involve victims. The use of 
alternatives to arrest, such as a summons, should also be con- 
sidered. 

• The selection and use of investigative methods. Problems con- 
cerning use of field interrogations and "stop-and-frisk" tech- 
niques are especially critical. Crime Commission studies and 
evidence before this Commission demonstrate that these tech- 
niques have the potential for becoming a major source of friction 
between police and minority groups. Their constitutionality is 
presently under review in the United States Supreme Court. We 
also recognize that police regard them as important methods of 
preventing and investigating crime. Although we do not advocate 

313 


use or adoption of any particular investigative method, we be- 
lieve that any such method should be covered by guidelines 
drafted to minimize friction with the community. 

• Safeguarding the constitutional right of free expression such as 
rights of persons engaging in lawful demonstrations, the need to 
protect lawful demonstrators, and how to handle spontaneous 
demonstrations. 

• The circumstances under which the various forms of physical 
force — including lethal force— can and should be applied. Rec- 
ognition of this need was demonstrated by the regulations 
recently adopted by the City of New York further implementing 
the state law governing police use of firearms. 

• The proper manner of address for contacts with any citizen. 

The drafting of guidelines should not be solely a police 
responsibility. It is the duty of mayors and other elected and 
appointed executive officials to take the initiative, to participate 
fully in the drafting and to ensure that the guidelines are 
carried out in practice. 

Police research and planning units should be fully used in 
identifying problem areas, performing the necessary studies 
and in resolving problems. Their product should be reviewed 
by the chief of police and city executives and representatives of 
the prosecution, courts, correction agencies and other criminal- 
justice agencies. Views of ghetto residents should be obtained, 
perhaps through police-community relations programs or 
human relations agencies. Once promulgated, the guidelines 
should be disseminated clearly and forcefully to all operational 
personnel. Concise, simply worded, and, if necessary, foreign 
language summaries of police powers and individual rights 
should be distributed to the public. Training the police to 
perform according to the guidelines is essential. Although 
conventional instruction is a minimum requirement, full under- 
standing can only be achieved by intensive small-group train- 
ing, involving simulation. 

Guidelines, no matter how carefully drafted, will have little 
effect unless the department enforces them. This primarily 
requires command supervision and commitment to the guide- 
lines. It also requires: 

• A strong internal investigative unit to enforce compliance. Such 
a unit should not only enforce the guidelines on a case-by-case 
basis against individual officers, but should also develop proce- 
dures to deter and prevent violations. The Crime Commission 
discussed the various methods available. 

• A fair and effective means to handle citizen complaints. 

Finally, provision should be made for the periodic review 
of the guidelines to ensure that changes are made to take 
account of current court rulings and new laws. 

314 


V. Community Support for Law Enforcement 

A fifth major reason for police-community hostility — partic- 
ularly obvious since the recent disorders — is the general break- 
down of communication between police and the ghetto. The 
contacts that do occur are primarily adversary contacts. 

In the section on police patrol practices, we discussed one 
basic aspect of this problem. Here we consider how police 
forces have tried, with varying degrees of success, to deal with 
three issues underlying relations with ghetto communities. 

Recruitment, Assignment and Promotion of Negroes 

The Crime Commission Police Task Force found that for 
police in a Negro community to be predominantly white can 
serve as a dangerous irritant; a feeling may develop that the 
community is not being policed to maintain civil peace but to 
maintain the status quo. It further found that contact with 
Negro officers can help to avoid stereotypes and prejudices in 
the minds of white officers. Negro officers also can increase 
departmental insight into ghetto problems, and provide infor- 
mation necessary for early anticipation of the tensions and 
grievances that can lead to disorders. Commission witnesses 
confirm these conclusions. 

There is evidence that Negro officers also can be particularly 
effective in controlling any disorders that do break out. In 
studying the relative performance of Army and National 
Guard forces in the Detroit disorder, we concluded that the 
higher percentage of Negroes in the Army forces contributed 
substantially to their better performance. As a result, last 
August, we recommended an increase in the percentage of 
Negroes in the National Guard. The need for increased Negro 
participation in police departments is equally acute. 

Despite this need — and despite recent efforts to hire more 
Negro police — the proportion of Negroes on police forces still 
falls far below the proportion of Negroes in the total popula- 
tion. Of 28 departments which reported information of this 
kind in a Commission survey of police departments, the per- 
centage of Negro sworn personnel ranged from less than 1 
percent to 21 percent. The median figure for Negro sworn 
personnel on the force was 6 percent; the median figure for 
the Negro population was approximately 24 percent. In no 
case was the proportion of Negroes in the police department 
equal to the proportion in the population.5 A 1962 survey of 

6 The data from this survey can be found in "Table A" at the end of this 
chapter of the Report. 

315 


the United States Civil Rights Commission, as reported in the 
Crime Commission Police Task Force Report, shows cor- 
respondingly low figures for other cities. 

There are even more marked disproportions of Negro super- 
visory personnel. Our survey showed the following ratios: 

• One in every 26 Negroes is a sergeant; the white ratio is one in 
12. 

• One in every 114 Negroes is a lieutenant; the white ratio is one 
in 26. 

• One in every 235 Negroes is a captain or above; the white ratio 
is one in 53. 

Public Safety Director Murphy testifying before the Com- 
mission described the problem and at least one of its causes: 

I think one of the serious problems facing the police in the 
nation today is the lack of adequate representation of Negroes 
in police departments. I think the police have not recruited 
enough Negroes in the past and are not recruiting enough of them 
today. I think we would be less than honest if we didn't admit 
that Negroes have been kept out of police departments in the 
past for reasons of racial discrimination. 

In a number of cities, particularly larger ones, police officials 
are not only willing but anxious to appoint Negro officers. 
There are obstacles other than discrimination. While these ob- 
stacles cannot readily be measured, they can be identified. One 
is the relatively high standards for police employment. Another 
is pay; better qualified Negroes are often more attracted by 
other, better paying positions. Another obstacle is the bad 
image of police in the Negro community. There also are ob- 
stacles to promotion apart from discrimination, such as the 
more limited educational background of some Negro officers. 

Recommendations 

The Commission recommends: 

• Police departments should intensify their efforts to recruit more 
Negroes. The Police Task Force of the Crime Commission dis- 
cussed a number of ways to do this and the problems involved. 
The Department of Defense program to help police departments 
recruit returning servicemen should be fully utilized. An Army 
report of Negro participation in the National Guard and Army 
reserves may also provide useful information. 

• In order to increase the number of Negroes in supervisory posi- 
tions, police departments should review promotion policies to 
ensure that Negroes have full opportunity to be rapidly and 
fairly promoted. 

• Negro officers should be so assigned as to ensure that the police 
department is fully and visibly integrated. Some cities have 
adopted a policy of assigning one white and one Negro officer to 

316 


patrol cars, especially in ghetto areas. These assignments result 
in better understanding, tempered judgment and increased ability 
to separate the truly suspect from the unfamiliar. 

Recruiting more Negro officers, alone, will not solve the 
problems of lack of communication and hostility toward police. 
A Negro's understanding of the ghetto is not enough to make 
him a good officer. He must also meet the same high standards 
as white officers and pass the same screening process. These 
requirements help create a dilemma noted by the Crime Com- 
mission. The need to develop better relations with minority 
group communities requires recruitment of police from these 
groups— groups handicapped by lack of educational oppor- 
tunities and achievement. To require that police recruits have 
a high school diploma sets a standard too low in terms of the 
need for recruiting college graduates and perhaps too high in 
terms of the need for recruiting members of minority groups. 

To meet this problem, the Crime Commission recommended 
creation of a new type of uniformed "community service offi- 
cer." This officer would typically be a young man between 17 
and 21 with the "aptitude, integrity, and stability necessary to 
perform police work." He would perform a variety of duties 
short of exercising full law enforcement powers, with primary 
emphasis on community service work. While so serving, he 
would continue his studies in order to be promoted as quickly 
as possible to the status of a police officer. 

The Commission recommends: 

• The community service officer program should be adopted. Use 
of this program to increase the number of Negroes in police 
departments will help to establish needed channels of commu- 
nication with the Negro community; will permit the police to 
perform better their community service functions, especially in 
the minority group neighborhoods; and will also create a num- 
ber of badly needed jobs for Negro youths. 

The standards of selection for such community service offi- 
cers or aides should be drawn to ensure that the great majority 
of young Negro males are eligible to participate in the program. 
As stated in the Crime Commission Task Force Report, selec- 
tion should not be based on inflexible educational requirements, 
but instead ". . . should be made on an individual basis with 
priority being given to applicants with promising aspirations, 
honesty, intelligence, a desire and a tested capacity to advance 
his education, and an understanding of the neighborhood and 
its problems." An arrest record or a minor conviction record 
should not in itself be a bar to employment. 

317 


The Commission recommends: 

• The federal government should launch a program to establish 
community service officers in cities with populations over 50,000. 
Eligible police departments should be reimbursed for 90 percent 
of the costs of employing one aide for every 10 full-time police 
officers. 

We emphasize, however, that recruitment of community 
service aides must complement, not replace, efforts to recruit 
more Negroes as police officers. 

Community Service Functions 

Because police run almost the only 24-hour day, seven-day- 
a-week emergency service, they find it very hard not to be- 
come involved in a host of nonpolice services. Complaints 
about a wide range of matters, from noisy neighbors and de- 
teriorated streets to building code violations, at best, are only 
peripheral to police work. Because these are often not police 
matters and because police increasingly face serious shortages 
of manpower and money, police administrators have system- 
atically resisted becoming involved in such matters. This re- 
sistance, coupled with centralization and motorization of the 
police, has resulted in the police becoming more distant from 
the people they serve. 

Recommendations 

The Commission believes that police cannot, and should not 
resist becoming involved in community service matters.6 There 
will be benefits for law enforcement no less than for public 
order. 

First, police, because of their "front line position" in dealing 
with ghetto problems, will be better able to identify problems 
in the community that may lead to disorder. Second, they will 
be better able to handle incidents requiring police intervention, 
particularly marital disputes that have a potential for violence. 
How well the police handle domestic disturbances affects the 
incidence of serious crimes, including assaults and homicides. 
Third, willing performance of such work can gain police the 
respect and support of the community. Finally, development 
of nonadversary contacts can provide the police with a vital 
source of information and intelligence concerning the com- 
munities they serve. 

8 We join in the Crime Commission's caveat that police should not become 
involved in service tasks which involve neither policing nor community help 
(such as tax collection, licensing and dog-pound duties).

J. ttruce Saumann from Brack Star 


A variety of methods have been devised to improve police 
performance of this service function. We comment on two of 
special interest. The first is the New York Police Department's 
experimental "Family Crisis Intervention" program to develop 
better police response to marital disputes; if results develop as 
expected, this may serve as a model for other departments. 

Second, neighborhood service centers have been suggested, 
and opened in some cities. These centers typically are estab- 
lished in tense, high-crime areas, in easily accessible locations 
such as store-fronts or public housing projects. Staffed by a 
civilian city employee as well as a police officer, their task is to 
provide information and service — putting a citizen in touch 
with the right agency, furnishing general advice. This gives the 
beat patrolman somewhere to refer a marital dispute. It gives 
the local resident a clear, simple contact with official advice. It 
gives the police in general the opportunity to provide services, 
not merely to enforce the law. The needed additional man- 
power for such centers could be provided by the community 
service aides recommended earlier, or by continuing to employ 
experienced policemen who have reached the age of retirement 

Community Relations Programs 

Many police departments have established programs to deal 
specifically with police-community relations. The Crime Com- 
mission recommended a number of such programs, and federal 
funds have been made available for putting them into opera- 
tion. Although of great potential benefit, the results thus far 
have been disappointing. This is true partly because the changes 
in attitude sought by such programs can only be achieved over 
time. But there are other reasons, as was shown by Detroit's 
experience with police-community meetings: minimum par- 
ticipation by ghetto residents; infrequent meetings; lack of 
patrolmen involvement; lack of attention to youth programs; 
lack of coordination by police leadership either within the 
department or with other city programs. 

More significantly, both the Detroit evaluation and studies 
carried on for the Commission show that too often these are 
not community relations programs, but public relations pro- 
grams, designed to improve the department's image in the 
community. In one major city covered by the Commission's 
study, the department's plan for citizen observers of police work 
failed because people believed that the citizen observer was 
allowed to see only what the police thought he should see. 
Similarly, the police chief's "open house," an opportunity for 
discussion, was considered useless by many who regarded him 
as unsympathetic and unresponsive. 

319 


Moreover, it is clear that these programs have little support 
among rank and file officers. In Detroit, more than a year after 
instructions were sent out to establish such programs, several 
precincts still had failed to do so. Other cities have had similar 
experiences. On the command level, there is often little interest. 
Programs are not integrated into the departments; units do not 
receive adequate budgetary support. 

Nevertheless, some programs have been successful. In At- 
lanta, a Crime Prevention Bureau has within two years estab- 
lished a good relationship with the community, particularly 
with the young people. It has concentrated on social services, 
persuading almost 600 dropouts to return to school, assisting 
some 250 hardship cases with food and work, arranging for 
dances and hydrant showers during the summer, working 
quickly and closely with families of missing persons. The re- 
sult is a close rapport with the community — and recruits for 
the department. Baltimore and Winston-Salem are reported to 
have equally successful programs. 

Recommendations 

Community relations programs and training can be im- 
portant in increasing communication and decreasing hostility 
between the police and the ghetto. Community relations pro- 
grams can also be used by police to explain new patrol prac- 
tices, law enforcement programs, and other police efforts to 
reduce crime. Police have a right to expect ghetto leaders to 
work responsibly to reduce crime. Community relations pro- 
grams offer a way to create and foster these efforts. 

We believe that community relations is an integral part of all 
law enforcement. But it cannot be made so by part-time effort, 
peripheral status, or cliche methods. 

One way to bolster community relations is to expand police 
department award systems. Traditionally, special awards, pro- 
motional credit, bonuses and selection for special assignments 
are based on heroic acts and arrest activity. Award systems 
should take equal cognizance of the work of officers who im- 
prove relations with alienated members of the community and 
by so doing minimize the potential for disorder. 

However, we see no easy solution to police-community rela- 
tions and misunderstandings and are aware that no single pro- 
cedure or program will suffice. Improving community relations 
is a full-time assignment for every commander and every offi- 
cer— an assignment that must include the development of an 
attitude, a tone, throughout the force that conforms with the 
ultimate responsibility of every policeman: public service.

Chapter 12 / Control o£ Disorder 


Introduction 

To analyze the complex social causes of disorder, to plumb 
the impact of generations of deprivation, to work for broad 
and sensitive efforts at prevention are vital tasks, but they are 
slow and difficult. When, in the meantime, civil disorder breaks 
out, three simple principles emerge. 

First: Preserving civil peace is the first responsibility of 
government. 

Individuals cannot be permitted to endanger the public peace 
and safety and public officials have a duty to make it clear 
that all just and necessary means to protect both will be used. 
Our society is founded on the rule of law. That rule must pre- 
vail; without it, we will lack not only order but the environ- 
ment essential to social and economic progress. 

Second: In maintaining the rule of law, we must be careful 
not to sacrifice it in the name of order. 

In our concern over civil disorder we must not mistake law- 
ful protest for illegal activities. The guardians of the law are 
also subject to the law they serve. As the FBI states in its riot 
manual for law enforcement officers: 

A peaceful or lawful demonstration should not be looked upon 
with disapproval by a police agency; rather, it should be con- 
sidered as a safety valve possibly serving to prevent a riot. The 
police agency should not countenance violations of law. How- 
ever, a police agency does not have the right to deny the dem- 
onstrator his constitutional rights. 

Third: Maintaining civil order is the responsibility of the 
entire community. 

Not even the most professional and devoted law enforce- 
ment agency alone can quell civil disorder any more than it 
alone can prevent civil disorder. A thin blue line is too thin. 
Maintaining civil peace is the responsibility of the entire com- 
munity, particularly public officials. The guidance, assistance, 
and support of the mayor can be decisive. 

This does not deny the very great responsibility which is 
and should be borne by the police. In the Supplement on Con- 
trol of Disorder we offer specific comments which we hope 

323 


will help law enforcement agencies regain control after major 
disorders have developed. In this chapter, however, the Com- 
mission considers ways by which the police — with the leader- 
ship and support of the civil authorities — can suppress and 
restrain potentially major disorders in their initial phases.1 

I. The Initial Incident 


Last summer, almost 150 cities experienced some form 
of civil disorder. Most remained minor disturbances, effective- 
ly controlled by the local police and civil authorities. In some 
cities similar incidents led to serious disorder. Why? 

Testimony and evidence studied by the Commission point 
to the preeminent role of police reaction to the initial incident. 
How the police and the community respond to and deal with 
such incidents may well determine whether they remain rela- 
tively minor police problems — or balloon into major disorders. 

Initial Police Response 

When police receive word of an accident, fight, or similar 
incident, a patrolman is routinely sent to the scene. He is 
called on to exercise technical and professional skills at which 
he is practiced — investigation, individual control and perhaps 

1In arriving at these assessments and recommendations, the Commission 
has relied heavily on information and advice supplied by many police, military 
and other leading authorities. In addition to the studies conducted for the 
Commission by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a number 
of outstanding authorities worked closely with the Commission staff and pro- 
vided invaluable assistance. In particular, we wish to thank John Ingersoll, 
Chief of Police of Charlotte, North Carolina, and former Director of Field 
Services of the International Association of Chiefs of Police; Daryl F. Gates, 
Deputy Chief of Police, Los Angeles Police Department, who was one of the 
commanders in the field during the Watts riot; and Major General George M. 
Gelston, Adjutant General of Maryland and former Police Commissioner of 
Baltimore. 

In addition to the testimony and reports received on the cities studied by 
the Commission and which had experienced disorders, the Commission drew 
upon the valuable information and material furnished by the Boston, Chicago, 
Cincinnati, Kansas City, Los Angeles, New York City and Oakland Police 
Departments. Valuable guidance also was provided by Colonel Orlando W. 
Wilson, until recently Superintendent of Police of Chicago and formerly Dean 
of the School of Criminology, University of California. 

The Commission also was markedly assisted by material made available by 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation and its pamphlet, "The Prevention and 
Control of Mobs and Riots," related reports by the Crime Commission, and 
information supplied by the Office of Public Safety, Agency for International 
Development. The Commission also received the active cooperation and 
assistance of the Department of Defense and in particular from the special 
Army task force established in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for 
Military Operations to study and make recommendations relative to the role 
of the Army and National Guard in controlling civil disorders.

arrest. Infrequently, he may have to call for assistance. In any 
event, his judgments, while important, normally have an im- 
pact only on the immediate participants. 

In the densely populated ghetto, however, particularly when 
summer heat drives many residents into the streets, even the 
most routine incident may call for far more than a technical 
assessment. The responding officer's initial judgment here is 
critical in two respects. First, it will guide his own conduct. 
Second, it will guide the response of his superiors. What orders, 
if any, should they give him? What help should they send if 
he asks for help? An assessment of this sort may be difficult 
for the best-informed officer. What makes it even more difficult 
is that police often do not know what to expect when they 
respond to incidents in ghetto areas where virtually all the 
1967 disorders occurred. 

The average police officer has little knowledge of under- 
standing of the underlying tensions and grievances that exist 
in the ghetto. Yet this information is vital if the police officer 
is to decide correctly what police or other control measures 
should be taken to deal with the incident. The task is to find 
ways to inform his judgment to the maximum extent possible. 

While good judgment cannot be institutionalized, some 
broad considerations can be offered. 

The Basic Factors 

Five factors, often inseparable, recurred in the major dis- 
orders of last summer: (1) crowded ghetto living conditions, 
worsened by summer heat; (2) youth on the streets; (3) hos- 
tility to police; (4) delay in appropriate police response; and 
(5) persistent rumors and inadequate information. 

On hot summer nights, the front steps and the street become 
a refuge from the stifling tenements of the ghetto. Detroit's 
12th Street, New Haven's Congress Street, and the grim public 
housing blocks of Newark illustrate how ghetto streets come 
alive with people, especially on summer nights and weekends 
— when many of the disorders of 1967 began. The people on 
the streets invariably include a very high proportion of youth. 

It takes little to attract a crowd in this setting. Making an 
arrest is a routine matter to many police officers. In the ghetto, 
it can draw a crowd instantly — quick to misunderstand, quick 
to characterize the police action as unfair, quick to abandon 
curiosity for anger. 

Crowded ghetto living conditions and youth on the streets 
— the first two factors — cannot be remedied by the police. 
But the police must take these conditions into account in 

325 


assessing even the most routine ghetto incident. Every police 
officer responding to a call in tense, heavily-populated areas 
must be sensitive to tension situations. Here more than in any 
other type of police duty, the individual officer must exercise 
good judgment and common sense. The Chicago Police De- 
partment issued the following training bulletin to all its per- 
sonnel: 

Preventing civil disorders is always easier than suppressing them. 
The police officer, by disciplining his emotions, recognizing the 
rights of all citizens, and conducting himself in the manner his 
office demands can do much to prevent a tension situation 
from erupting into a serious disturbance.2 

There are, however, steps police can take to eliminate or 
minimize the effects of the remaining three factors. 

In the preceding chapter, we have already discussed the 
factor of hostility to police. 

As to delay, sufficient manpower is a prerequisite for con- 
trolling potentially dangerous crowds; the speed with which 
it arrives may well determine whether the situation can be 
controlled. In the summer of 1967 we believe that delay in 
mobilizing help permitted several incidents to develop into 
dangerous disorders, in the end requiring far more personnel 
and creating increased hazards to life and property. 

Rumors significantly aggravated tension and disorder in 
more than 65 percent of the disorders studied by the Com- 
mission. Sometimes, as in Tampa and New Haven, rumor 
served as the spark which turned an incident into a civil dis- 
order. Elsewhere, notably Detroit and Newark, even where 
they were not precipitating or motivating factors, inflaming 
rumors made the job of police and community leaders far 
more difficult. 

Experience also has shown that the harmful effect of rumors 
can be offset if police, public officials, and community leaders 
quickly and effectively circulate the facts. The Commission 
recommends that loudspeakers should be available to police 
at the scene of an incident. Radio and television announce- 
ments and special telephone networks to reach many neigh- 
borhood residents have been effective. 

An innovative method is that of a "Rumor Central" — an 
office responsible for the collection, evaluation, and counter- 
ing of rumors which could lead to civil disorder.3 To be

Department.

Disorder. 

326 


most effective, such units might be located outside police de- 
partments. In any event, they should work closely with police 
and other public officials. 

II. Control Capabilities 

Whenever an initial incident erupts into a major crowd con- 
trol problem, most police departments are confronted with a 
difficult manpower problem. A police department normally has 
only about 13 percent of its uniformed force on duty during 
the peak 4 p.m. to midnight watch, when nearly all the 
riots studied by the Commission began. For example, a city 
like Cincinnati, with a population of about 500,000 and an 
area of 77 square miles, would normally have fewer than 100 
uniformed policemen available if trouble broke out. A city 
like Peoria, Illinois, with a population of about 100,000, 
would have less than 25 uniformed patrolmen on hand.4 

Dispersal is also a factor. Normal police operations require 
personnel to be distributed over the entire geographical area 
of a city. When disorder breaks out, the task of mobilizing all 
available manpower is enormous. The police administrator 
must weigh the need for police to control the riot against the 
risks of leaving vital areas of the city without police protec- 
tion. 

It is apparent that most American cities would not have 
enough policemen quickly available to assure control in the 
event of a sudden large disorder. A high premium must hence 
be placed on the capability to prevent disorders — or to con- 
tain them before they develop into serious proportions. 

Training 

Despite the obvious importance of well-trained police in 
controlling disorder, the Commission survey of the capabilities 
of selected police departments disclosed serious deficiencies. 
For example, riot-control training is usually given to recruits. 
This averaged 18 hours for the departments surveyed, rang- 
ing from 62 hours to only two. Little additional training is 
provided for command-level officers. By contrast, the National 
Guard now receives a minimum of 32 hours of riot control 

*The majority of American cities between 50,000 and 100,000 population 
have less than 100 policemen. Of those with over 100,000 population, 71 per- 
cent have less than 500 policemen. Only 19 cities have more than 1000. As 
suggested by the cited figure of 13 percent manpower available, these figures 
are deceptively reassuring. Considering three shifts, days off, vacations and 
sick leave, five men are required to keep one police post manned 24 hours a 
day. In addition, manpower for regular police services like administration, 
records and detective work must be taken into account. 

327 


training under new U.S. Army regulations and National Guard 
officers receive 16 hours of command training for disorder 
situations. 

The deficiencies in police training for disorders are mag- 
nified by the fact that standard police training and operations 
differ radically from training needed for the control of riots. 
Traditional training and emphasis have been on the individual 
policeman. His routine duties involve isolated incidents and 
dealings with small numbers of people at one time. The nature 
of his work — riding or walking mostly alone or in pairs — 
means that he has considerable individual discretion. 

The control of civil disturbances, on the other hand, requires 
large numbers of disciplined personnel, comparable to soldiers 
in a military unit, organized and trained to work as a team 
under a highly unified command and control system. Thus 
when a civil disturbance occurs, a police department must 
suddenly shift into a new type of organization with different 
operational procedures. The individual officer must stop acting 
independently and begin to perform as a member of a closely 
supervised, disciplined team. Our survey disclosed that train- 
ing in practically all departments is limited to the individual. 

Last year's disorders demonstrated that the control problems 
encountered were different even from those for which riot- 
control training had been designed. Violence often involved 
small groups and hit-and-run tactics. Except in the later stages 
of the largest disorders, the crowds included large numbers of 
spectators not active in looting or destruction. Since they were 
mostly residents of the area, dispersal alone was futile. As a 
result, training in conventional riot-control formations and 
tactics, designed primarily to control and disperse mobs, was 
often inapplicable and ineffective. 

Few departments have the resources and expertise to pro- 
vide adequate and relevant training for control of serious dis- 
orders. We discuss this problem in greater detail in our Supple- 
ment on the Control of Disorder, and set forth additional 
recommendations. 

Discipline and Command 

As the Riot Profiles in the opening chapter of the Report 
have shown, discipline of the control force is a crucial factor. 
Officers at the scene of a ghetto disorder are likely to suffer 
vilification, and to be the targets for rocks or bottles. Neverthe- 
less, police discipline must be sufficiently strong so that an indi- 
vidual officer is not provoked into unilateral action. He must 
develop sufficient confidence in himself and his fellow officers 
to avoid panic or the indiscriminate — and inflammatory — use 

328 


of force that has sometimes occurred in the heat of disorders. 
Discipline of this sort depends on the leadership of seasoned 
commanders and the presence in the field of sufficient super- 
visory officers to make major decisions. 

The ability of police commanders to maintain command 
and control of units at the scene of disorder is severely handi- 
capped by deficiencies in police communications. Police depart- 
ments usually can communicate with their personnel only 
through radios in police vehicles. Once the officer leaves his 
police car or motorcycle, he loses communication with his 
superiors and is outside their effective control. 

The military has field communications systems which make 
it possible to achieve effective command and control. The 
nation's police departments do not. A more complete dis- 
cussion of this problem and the Commission's recommenda- 
tions are contained in the Supplement. 

Police Tactics 

There are no all-purpose control tactics. Last summer's dis- 
orders demonstrated repeatedly that tactics which are effective 
in one situation may be totally ineffective in another. The car- 
dinal requirement is to have enough men and control equip- 
ment available to carry out effectively whatever tactics are 
necessary and appropriate according to the dictates of sound 
judgment. 

Tactical operations are dealt with in the Supplement. Spe- 
cific riot control tactics are discussed in the Model Operations 
Plan, described in the Supplement, which has been prepared 
for separate distribution to police departments. 

III. The Use of Force 
Justification of Deadly Force 

There are at least three serious problems involved in the 
use of deadly weapons in a civil disorder. The first is the risk 
of killing or wounding innocent persons — bystanders or pas- 
sersby who may in fact be hundreds of feet away when a shot is 
fired. 

The second is the justification for the use of deadly force 
against looting or vandalism. Are bullets the correct response 
to offenses of this sort? Major General George Gelston5 told 
the Commission: ... "I am not going to order a man killed for 

6 Adjutant General of Maryland, commander of National Guard forces in 
Cambridge, Maryland last summer, and former Police Commissioner of 
Baltimore. 

329 


stealing a six-pack of beer or a television set." Instead, he said, 
a non-lethal tear gas can stop any looting. 

The third problem is that the use of excessive force — even 
the inappropriate display of weapons — may be inflammatory 
and lead to even worse disorder. As the FBI riot control man- 
ual states: 

The basic rule, when applying force, is to use only the minimum 
force necessary to effectively control the situation. Unwarranted 
application of force will incite the mob to further violence, as 
well as kindle seeds of resentment for police that, in turn, could 
cause a riot to recur. Ill-advised or excessive application of 
force will not only result in charges of police brutality, but 
also may prolong the disturbance. 

Such counsel with respect to disorders accords with the clearly 
established legal and social principle of minimum use of force 
by police. 

The major difficulty in dealing with all these problems, 
however, is the limited choice still presented to police in mass 
disorders: to use too much force or too little. The police who 
were faced with the New York riot of 1863 were equipped 
with two weapons — a wooden stick and a gun. For the most 
part, the police faced with urban disorders last summer had to 
rely on two weapons — a wooden stick and a gun. 

Our police departments today require a middle range of 
physical force with which to restrain and control both more 
humanely and more effectively. 

Alternatives to Deadly Force 

The dilemma regarding force has endured for more than a 
century for two reasons. One is that police are inhibited from 
using even the new tools which have been developed. The 
second is that the improvement and perfection of these tools 
is proceeding far too slowly. 

As pointed out in the Supplement, fear of public reaction 
and other policy considerations have tended to inhibit police 
use of nonlethal chemical agents in civil disorders. The U.S. 
Army, on the other hand, relies heavily on the use of CS, a 
chemical agent, for controlling riots. The Army has found it 
to be both much more effective and safer than the more tradi- 
tional tear gas, CN. The use of CS is prescribed in the stan- 
dard military sequence of force prior to the employment of 
any lethal firearms. Moreover, new developments now make 
it possible to use chemical agents selectively against individuals 
and small groups with minimum danger to innocent persons. 
Thus the understandable concern of many police and public 

330 


officials as to the wisdom of using massive amounts of gas in 
densely populated areas need no longer prove a barrier. 

The value and effectiveness of chemical agents in restoring 
law and order, with minimum danger to lives and property, 
is also attested by the FBI's riot control manual: "Chemical 
agents . . . can negate the numerical superiority the mob has 
over the police force. They are the most effective and most 
humane means of achieving temporary, neutralization of a 
mob with a minimum of personal injury." 

The Commission recommends that in suppressing disorder, 
the police, whenever possible, follow the example of the U.S. 
Army in requiring the use of chemical agents before the use 
of deadly weapons. 

The experience of many police forces has demonstrated, 
however, that the value and community acceptance of new 
nonlethal methods may be jeopardized if police officers em- 
ploy them in an indiscriminate way. In some of the cities we 
studied, reports of improper use of some chemical weapons 
by individual police officers have led to charges that these 
weapons are brutalizing or demeaning. To assure public con- 
fidence and prevent misuse, police administrators should issue 
clear guidelines on where and how police may employ such 
control measures. 

The Commission has received many suggestions for other 
nonlethal control equipment. Distinctive marking dyes or 
odors and the filming of rioters have been recommended both 
to deter and positively identify persons guilty of illegal acts. 
Sticky tapes, adhesive blobs, and liquid foam are advocated 
to immobilize or block rioters. Intensely bright lights and loud 
distressing sounds capable of creating temporary disability 
may prove to be useful. Technology will provide still other 
tools. 

There is need for additional experience and evaluation 
before the police and the public can be reasonably assured 
that these control innovations meet the performance and 
safety standards required for use in civilian communities. The 
Commission believes, however, that the urgent need for non- 
lethal alternatives requires immediate attention and federal 
support. We discuss this further in the Supplement. 

IV.  Community Assistance in Disorder Control 

Commission studies have shown that in a number of in- 
stances both police and other responsible civil authorities were 
forced to make decisions without adequate facts in an atmos- 
phere charged by rumor. 

Police  administrators  consulted by the  Commission em- 

331 


phasized the importance of employing trained police intelli- 
gence officers to collect, evaluate and disseminate information. 
The use ot undercover police officers, reliable informants and 
the assignment of police personnel to provide fast, accurate, 
on-the-scene reports were all cited as essential. 

During the early stage of a disorder when lawlessness is 
still relatively restricted, the cooperation and assistance of 
Negro leaders and other community residents with a common 
interest in the maintenance of order can be extremely valu- 
able. They can provide the police with the kind of pertinent, 
reliable information essential for decision-making during the 
disorder. Many agencies and organizations in the area, public 
and private, have valuable contacts and channels of com- 
munication. These also can serve as important information 
resources. 

In some cities, "counter-rioters" have played an important 
role in dampening disturbance. Volunteers have assisted in 
restoring order by patrolling their neighborhoods and trying 
independently to persuade others to go home. Sometimes local 
authorities have actively recruited ghetto residents to perform 
these missions. The Commission believes that mayors and 
police chiefs should recognize and assess carefully the poten- 
tial benefit such efforts can. sometimes provide, restoring the 
peace in a way that will earn public support and confidence. 

The larger question, however — whether police should with- 
draw from the disorder area and let the community leaders 
or forces seek to cool the rioting — raises a number of critical 
issues. The first and most important is whether by so doing 
the police are abdicating their basic responsibility to maintain 
order and protect lives and property. 

Some police administrators are deeply convinced that it is 
a dereliction of duty for police to delegate complete authority 
to individuals or groups who lack legal responsibility. In their 
judgment, such actions creates the danger of vigilante groups. 

The Commission shares this concern; a sanctioned control 
group could use its position to intimidate or terrorize. Those 
who come forward to discourage rioting may have no in- 
fluence with the rioters. If they fail, they may well blame 
officials, creating new enforcement problems. 

The Commission believes that only the mayor — who has 
the ultimate responsibility for the welfare and safety of the 
community — can, with the advice of the police administrator, 
make the critical judgment. 


332 


The Role of Public Officials 

The Commission believes incidents are less likely to escalate 
into larger violence if ghetto residents know they have ef- 
fective political channels of protest. We discussed formal 
grievance outlets at length in the preceding chapters. Here 
we are particularly concerned with the role of the mayor or 
city manager or police chief. 

Civil disorders are fundamental governmental problems, 
not simply police matters. As the chief elected official, the 
mayor must take ultimate responsibility for all governmental 
action in times of disorder. To make this meaningful, he must 
have the corresponding authority and control. He must become 
fully involved in disorder planning and operations. He must 
understand the nature of the problems posed by a disorder, 
the strategy of j-esponse and the pattern of field operations. 

In some cities, mayors have taken the view that disorders 
were entirely police matters. This represents a failure to ac- 
cept a fundamental responsibility. The unwillingness of a 
mayor to become personally involved and negotiate grievances 
with local residents may cut off a vital outlet for peaceful 
protest. 

Similarly, police chiefs should understand this responsi- 
bility and involve the mayor in their planning activities and 
operations. Only regular participation by the mayor in police 
problems, in cold winters as well as hot summers, will educate 
both the mayor and the police to the mutually reinforcing 
nature of their relationship. 

Parallel responsibilities exist at the state level. Governors 
and other civilian officials with responsibility over state law 
enforcement activities, such as attorneys general, have an 
obligation to supervise planning and operations for civil dis- 
orders. 

One of the most important responsibilities of local officials 
is to maintain close personal contact with the ghetto. The im- 
portance of creating channels of communication with minis- 
ters, with community organizations, with Negro leaders in- 
cluding young activists and militants cannot be overestimated. 
Given such contacts, officials become more sensitive to ghetto 
reactions to particular episodes and frictions. They also create 
acquaintanceships which can be used to help alleviate tensions 
that might otherwise heighten. 

As the Riot Profiles indicate, in a number of the disorders 
studied by the Commission, efforts were made to respond to 
grievances. In some instances, Negro leaders took the initia- 
tive. In others, mayors and state officials did so. In New 

333 


Brunswick, for example, discussion alleviated tension and led 
to a peaceful settlement. Often the determination of civilian 
officials, especially the mayor, to seek out these opportunities 
may be decisive in avoiding violence. 

Having determined that it will try to resolve its problems by 
political means, the city must then decide with whom to 
negotiate — often a difficult question. Large meetings open to 
the general public or small meetings limited to established, 
older Negro leaders were rarely found to be effective. City offi- 
cials are often faced with a fragmented Negro community. If 
they have failed to keep open broad channels of communica- 
tion, city officials will have great difficulty identifying leaders 
with sufficient influence to get through to those on the streets. 

Even after contacts are made, negotiations may be extreme- 
ly difficult. Younger, militant leaders are often distrustful of 
city government, fearful of compromising their militancy or 
their leadership by allying themselves too closely with "the 
power structure," particularly when that structure may have 
nothing to deliver. 

Civil disorders require the maximum coordination of the 
activities of all governmental agencies. Such cooperation can 
only be brought about by the chief executive. Examples are 
joint operations by the police and fire departments, mutual 
assistance agreements with neighboring communities, and state 
and federal assistance. These problems are discussed in the 
Supplement. 

V.  Danger of Overreaction 

Emergencies are anticipated in police planning. They range 
from natural threats like floods and storms to man-made 
incidents like the recent disorders. Until 1964, most civil dis- 
orders were regarded as difficult but basically manageable 
police problems of an essentially local nature. The events of 
the last few summers, however, particularly the events of 
1967, have radically changed this view. Disturbances in dense- 
ly populated, predominantly Negro areas which might earlier 
have been labelled brawls became characterized as "riots," 
with racial overtones. A national climate of tension and fear 
developed, particularly in cities with large Negro populations. 

Were relatively minor incidents inflated or escalated into 
serious disturbances? Did such inflation result from overly 
aggressive law enforcement action? Did it stem from unwar- 
ranted fears on the part of the ghetto community? Precise 
answers are impossible. What can be said, however, is that 
there was widespread misunderstanding and exaggeration of 
what did occur. 

334 


The most notable example is the belief widely held across 
the country last summer that riot cities were paralyzed by 
sniper fire. Of 23 cities surveyed by the Commission, there 
had been reports of sniping in at least 15. What is probable, al- 
though the evidence is fragmentary, is that there was at least 
some sniping. What is certain is that the amount of sniping 
attributed to rioters — by law enforcement officials as well as 
the press — was highly exaggerated. 

According to the best information available to the Com- 
mission, most reported sniping incidents were demonstrated 
to be gunfire by either police or National Guardsmen. 

The climate of fear and expectation of violence created 
by such exaggerated, sometimes totally erroneous, reports 
demonstrates the serious risks of overreaction and excessive 
use of force. In particular, the Commission is deeply con- 
cerned that, in their anxiety to control disorders, some law 
enforcement agencies may resort to indiscriminate, repressive 
use of force against wholly innocent elements of the Negro 
community. The injustice of such conduct — and its abrasive 
effects — would be incalculable. 

Elected officials, police and National Guard officials must 
take effective steps to prevent false assessments and the tragic 
consequences that could follow. This will require improved 
communications. It will require reliable intelligence about 
ghetto problems and incidents. It will require, equally, as- 
surance of steadfast discipline among control personnel. 

Funding of Recommendations for Prevention and 
Control of Disorders 

Many of the recommendations in this and the preceding 
chapter will be costly. Studies of police practices, intensified 
recruitment of Negro officers, increased planning and training 
for disorder control — all would impose heavy financial burdens 
on communities already hard-pressed by the increasing costs 
of their present systems of criminal justice. 

The Commission recommends that the federal government 
bear a part of this burden. 

Federal funding need not and should not in any way infringe 
on the principle of local law enforcement authority. The fed- 
eral government already finances a variety of law enforce- 
ment assistance programs without such infringement. The De- 
partment of Justice provides direct grants for research, plan- 
ning and demonstration through the Office of Law Enforce- 
ment Assistance, and the FBI conducts training programs for 
state and local police officers. The Department of Health, Edu- 
cation and Welfare administers juvenile delinquency control 

335 


programs and educational grants for law enforcement studies. 
The Department of Labor helps pay for Police Cadet Training 
programs. The Office of Economic Opportunity assists in 
police-community relations activities. We commend and en- 
dorse these efforts. But we believe more federal financial as- 
sistance is needed. 

Such assistance should take two forms. First, in this chapter, 
the preceding one, and in the Supplement, we specifically 
recommend federal funding for certain programs — commu- 
nity service officers, development of portable communications 
equipment, a national clearing house for training information, 
and nonlethal weapons development. 

Second, we also believe that more federal support is neces- 
sary to help local communities improve the overall quality 
of their criminal justice systems. With the Crime Commission, 
we believe that the federal government ". . . can make a 
dramatic new contribution to the national effort against crime 
by greatly expanding its support of the agencies of justice 
in the states and in the cities." 

These remarks are in no way intended to excuse local gov- 
ernments from their financial responsibilities. Improved law 
enforcement at the local level, including increased capacity to 
prevent and control civil disorders, is possible only if local 
citizens are willing to put their tax money where their desires 
are. But this Commission believes that not even the most de- 
voted and willing community can succeed acting alone. Only 
the federal government is in a position to provide expertise, 
conduct and evaluate comprehensive test programs, and pay 
for the large capital investment necessary to develop experi- 
mental programs and new equipment. 

The Crime Commission outlined a broad program of fed- 
eral funding, advice, and assistance to meet major criminal jus- 
tice needs. It estimated that in the next decade, several hundred 
million dollars could be profitably spent each year on this 
program. The increased demands imposed on law enforcement 
agencies by the recent disorders have intensified the urgency 
and increased the cost of such a program. 

Nevertheless, 14 months have now passed since the Crime 
Commission's exhaustive study and recommendations; 13 
months have passed since the President first urged the Congress 
to enact such a program; that urgent request was renewed by 
the President in his Public Safety Message of February 7, 
1968. No final action has yet been taken. It should be taken — 
and taken promptly. Because law enforcement is a local 
responsibility, whatever legislation is adopted should permit 
direct grants to municipal governments. Funding should be at 
least as high as that requested by the President in his Message.

Chapter 13 / The Administration of Justice 
Under Emergency Conditions 

I.  The Condition in Our Lower Courts 

A riot in the city poses a separate crisis in the administra- 
tion of justice. Partially paralyzed by decades of neglect, de- 
ficient in facilities, procedures and personnel, overwhelmed by 
the demands of normal operations, lower courts have staggered 
under the crushing new burdens of civil disorders. 

Some of our courts, moreover, have lost the confidence of 
the poor. This judgment is underwritten by the members and 
staff of this Commission, who have gone into the courthouses 
and ghettos of the cities torn by the riots of 1967. The belief 
is pervasive among ghetto residents that lower courts in our 
urban communities dispense "assembly-line" justice; that from 
arrest to sentencing, the poor and uneducated are denied equal 
justice with the affluent, that procedures such as bail and fines 
have been perverted to perpetuate class inequities. We have 
found that the apparatus of justice in some areas has itself 
become a focus for distrust and hostility. Too often the courts 
have operated to aggravate rather than relieve the tensions 
that ignite and fire disorders. 

The quality of justice which the courts dispense in time of 
civil crisis is one of the indices of the capacity of a democratic 
society to survive. To see that this quality does not become 
strained is therefore a task of critical importance. 

"No program of crime prevention," the President's Com- 
mission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Jus- 
tice found, "will be effective without a massive overhaul of 
the lower criminal courts."1 The range of needed reforms 
recommended in their report is broad: increasing judicial man- 
power and reforming the selection and tenure of judges; pro- 
viding more prosecutors, defense counsel, and probation of- 
ficers and training them adequately; modernizing the physical 
facilities and administration of the courts; creating unified

state court systems; coordinating statewide the operations of 
local prosecutors; improving the informational basis for pre- 
trial screening and negotiated pleas; revising the bail system 
and setting up systems for station-house summons and re- 
lease for persons accused of certain offenses; revising sen- 
tencing laws and policies toward a more just structure. 

If we are to provide our judicial institutions with sufficient 
capacity to cope effectively with civil disorders, these reforms 
are vitally necessary. They are long overdue. The responsi- 
bility for this effort will rest heavily on the organized bar of 
the community. The prevalence of "assembly-line" justice is 
evidence that in many localities, the bar has not met its leader- 
ship responsibilities. 

II.  The Experience of Summer 1967 

In the cities shaken by disorders during the summer of 
1967, there were recurring breakdowns in the mechanisms for 
processing, prosecuting and protecting arrested persons. In 
the main, these resulted from the communities' failure to an- 
ticipate, and plan for, the emergency judicial needs of civil 
disorders, and from longstanding structural deficiencies in 
criminal court systems distended grotesquely to process a mas- 
sive influx of cases. In many instances tensions and hostilities 
from the streets infected the quality of justice dispensed by 
the courts. 

While final information on the processing of riot offenders 
is not yet assembled, the information presently available pro- 
vides valuable guidelines for future planning. 

The goals of criminal justice under conditions of civil dis- 
order are basic: 


• To insure the apprehension and subsequent conviction of those 
who riot, incite to riot or have committed acts of physical Violence 
or caused substantial property damage. 

• To insure that law violators are subjected to criminal process, and 
that disposition of their cases is commensurate with the severity 
of the offense; to provide, at the same time, for just but compas- 
sionate disposition of inadvertent, casual, or minor offenders. 

• To provide prompt, fair judicial hearings for arrested persons 
under conditions which do not aggravate grievances within the 
affected areas. 

In the summer of 1967, these goals too often were disre- 
garded or unattainable. 

338 


Few Successful Prosecutions for Serious Crimes Committed 
During the Riot Period 

In Detroit, 26 alleged snipers were charged with assault 
with intent to commit murder. Twenty-three of those charges 
were subsequently dismissed. As of September 30, 1967, one 
out of seven homicide arrests had resulted in a conviction; two 
were still pending. Of 253 assault arrests only 11 convictions 
were produced; 58 were still pending. Twenty-one out of 34 
arson arrests, and 22 out of 28 inciting to riot arrests, had been 
dropped by the prosecution.2 

Three elements impaired successful prosecution of persons 
arrested for major offenses: 

First, the technique of mass arrest was sometimes used to 
clear the streets. Those arrested often included innocent spec- 
tators and minor violators along with major offenders. In New- 
ark and Detroit, mass street arrests were made in sectors 
where sniping was reported and extensive looting occurred. 

Second, the obstacles to deliberate, painstaking, on-the- 
scene investigations during a riot are formidable. Thus, in- 
sufficient evidence was obtained to insure conviction on many 
of the most serious charges. 

Third, the masses of arrestees in the major riots so over- 
whelmed processing and pre-trial procedures that facilities 
and personnel were not free to deal adequately with serious 
offenders or with evidence of their crimes. Personnel in police 
stations were overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of accused 
persons to be booked, screened, detained, and eventually 
brought to court. Minor and major offenders were herded 
unselectively through the process.3 

Assembly-line booking operations in the Detroit precincts 
and at the jail — 20 to 30 employees assigned to 12 hour shifts 
— proved inadequate. Records necessary to identify defendants 
or to check for past criminal records could not be obtained. 
Follow-up investigation, essential to secure convictions in se- 
rious cases, proved difficult or impossible. 

With lesser crimes as well, the system displayed an inability 
to produce successful prosecutions. Looting charges comprised 
84% of the felony arrests in Detroit.4 Yet almost half of the 

2 In the 1965 Watts riot, of seven persons arrested on homicide charges, five 
were subsequently released. None has yet been convicted. A total of 120 adult 
arrests for assault produced only 60 convictions; 27 adult arson arrests: seven 
convictions. In Newark, one homicide indictment and 22 assault indictments 
(none for sniping) have been returned. 

8 In Detroit 7,231 arrests were made during the nine day riot, in Newark 
1,510 in five days. In one week, the Detroit Recorder's Court handled a 
month's quota of misdemeanor cases and a six months' quota of felony cases. 

* Fifty-five percent of all prosecuted arrests were for looting. Twenty-four 
percent of all riot arrests for felonies were not prosecuted. 

339 


felony charges that went to court were dismissed at prelim- 
inary hearing for lack of evidence.5 

Serious Overcrowding of Facilities 

From the point of arrest on, accused persons in Detroit and 
Newark suffered the abuses of an overtaxed and harassed sys- 
tem of justice. In Detroit, inability to maintain a centralized 
system of arrest records meant that families and defense at- 
torneys could not locate arrested persons confined in widely 
scattered emergency detention facilities. In one day alone, 790 
persons were booked at the Wayne County Jail and 1,068 sent 
on to other detention facilities, usually without opportunity 
to notify or consult family or counsel. 

Regular detention facilities were swamped. Detroit's main 
city jail, built for 1,200 persons, was crammed wtih over 
1,700. Precinct lockups built for 50 prisoners received 150 
or more. The juvenile detention home built for 120 held over 
600 during the riot. Makeshift detention facilities were com- 
mandeered; 1,000 arrestees were held in an underground po- 
lice garage for several days, many without adequate food or 
water. Others were held for over 24 hours in city buses. Adults 
of both sexes were sometimes locked up together. In Newark, 
a large portion of those arrested were held in an armory with- 
out proper food, water, toilet or medical facilities. Prisoners 
had no way to contact lawyers or relatives. Members of the 
press or official observers were unable to reassure those on 
the outside. In the absence of information about arrestees, 
new rumors and fears added to the tensions of the riot. 

Judicial Procedures Oriented to Mass Rather Than Individual- 
ized Justice 

Normal screening procedures were overrun in the chaos of 
the major disorders. Rational decisions to prosecute, to delay 
prosecution on good behavior, to dismiss, to release with or 
without bail pending trial, to accept a plea to a lesser charge 
or to press for conviction on the original charge, and to impose 
a just sentence require access to a comprehensive file of infor- 
mation on the offender contributed by police, prosecution, de- 
fense counsel, bail interviewers and probation officers. Orderly 
screening requires time, personnel, deliberation. These ele- 
ments were absent in the court processing of those arrested in 
the major riots. 

6 Sixty percent of felony riot charges went to preliminary hearing. At this 
stage, 49 percent of those charges were dismissed, as compared with only 23 
percent of felony charges dismissed during 1966. 

340 


ARRAIGNMENTS AND BAIL SETTINGS 

In Detroit defendants were herded to arraignment in 
groups.6 There was little chance to screen out those cases that 
could best be handled out of court or which could not survive 
trial. Defense counsel were not allowed to represent defendants 
at this stage in Detroit. Some judges failed to advise the de- 
fendants of their legal rights. After one group-arraignment, a 
Detroit judge told the next group of defendants, "You heard 
what I said to them. The same things apply to you." 

Arraignments in the major riot cities were often delayed 
several days, thus denying defendants the right to prompt bail. 
In Detroit many persons arrested for minor ordinance viola- 
tions were jailed for a number of days before going to court. 
When the judicial process was finally activated for them, most 
judges tended to set inordinately high bail so as to frustrate 
release.7 Pressure on detention facilities thus remained at in- 
tolerable levels for several days. Bail for offenses such as loot- 
ing and property destruction was set as high as $50,000; for 
assault up to $200,000. Bond for curfew violations was rarely 
set at less than $10,000— often as high as $15,000 to $25,000.8 
In Newark bail was uniformly set at $500 for curfew offenses, 
$250 for loitering and at $2,500 and up for property offenses. 
No attempt was made in most cases to individualize the bail 
setting process. Pressured by unattainably high bail, many 
indigent defendants pleaded guilty or accepted immediate trial 
when offered. 

In both Newark and Detroit, detention pressures finally 
forced a more lenient bail policy. In what were essentially 
duplications of earlier bail hearings, prisoners were interviewed 

~"*R)ne thousand defendants were arraigned in a single day in the Detroit 
Recorder's Court (250 per six-hour shift). Information usually available to the 
judge at arraignment on the warrant — i.e., fingerprint checks, interviews, inves- 
tigative reports, formal complaints — was often missing due to the logjam in 
the warrant clerk's office. Grand jury proceedings suffered similarly. Mass 
indictments naming 100 or more defendants were handed down in all-day 
sessions in Newark after average deliberation of less than two minutes per case. 

7 In Detroit, the prosecutor announced this policy publicly and most of the 
judges acceded. The Recorder's Court in 1966 released 26 percent on their own 
bond. During the riot the figure was 2 percent. Acceptance of money bonds in 
any amount was suspended during one 24-hour period. Offers of defense 
counsel to represent defendants at bail hearings were rejected. 

8 A survey of Detroit riot defendants held in Jackson State Prison for lack 
of bail, showed only 9 percent with bond set below $1,500; 14 percent with 
bond set between $1,500 and $2,500; 20 percent between $5,000 and $10,000; 
44 percent between $10,000 and $25,000. Another survey of defendants im- 
prisoned in Milan federal penitentiary who were arrested on the first day of 
the riot for property offenses, showed 90 percent with bond set between 
$10,000 and $50,000. 

341 


and released without bail in large numbers.9 In Newark, an 
ROR (release on the defendant's own recognizance) program 
initiated in the last days of the riot interviewed over 700 prison- 
ers (at least half of all those arrested) and secured the release 
of between 65 and 80 percent. 

Courts in several of the smaller cities successfully experi- 
mented with release of offenders on their own recognizance 
from the beginning of the riot. Dayton continued its release 
on recognizance policy during its September disorder. Most 
of the 203 people arrested were released without money bail, 
In New Haven — out of 550 arrested — 80 percent were released 
on their own recognizance. 

"counsel 

The riots underscored other deficiencies in local court sys- 
tems. Most prominent in the major outbreaks was the shortage 
of skilled defense lawyers to handle the influx of cases in any 
fashion approximating individual representation. Even where 
volunteer lawyers labored overtime, the system was badly 
strained. Individual counsel was rarely available. Inexperienced 
lawyers in Detroit were given briefings by experienced crimi- 
nal attorneys and were handed procedural handbooks before 
entering the court rooms.10 They had no opportunity to bargain 
for pleas before arraignment, or even to see police files before 
preliminary hearings. In several cities (Detroit, Newark, and 
New Brunswick), volunteer attorneys were denied access to 
prisoners in jail — in one case because they did not know the 
prisoners' names. While individual lawyers and legal organiza- 
tions in several cities provided counsel to represent minor viola- 
tors (Milwaukee, the Legal Services program; New Haven, the 
Legal Assistance Association; Cincinnati, the American Civil 
Liberties Union, National Association for the Advancement 
Of Colored People and Legal Aid Society); in others (Rock- 

9 The prosecutor finally initiated the lenient bail policy in Detroit. (One 
judge, however, used bail examiners throughout the riot and released 10 per- 
cent of defendants who came before him on their own recognizance.) Over 
3,000 were released within a few days through bail review; by August 4, only 
1,200 remained in detention. Files were flown to the FBI for checking to 
expedite release. Only one known re-arrest (for curfew violation) was reported 
from among such persons released. When preliminary examinations began on 
August 1, most defendants were released on $500 personal bond, except in 
violent crimes or cases of serious prior records. 

In Newark, on the Sunday following the Wednesday the riot began, the 
judges went into the jails to conduct bail review hearings. 

"The Detroit Bar Association mustered over 700 lawyers (10 to 15 percent 
of its membership) to serve as defense counsel. They were used primarily at 
preliminary hearings and arraignments on the information — not at initial bail 
hearings. 

342 


ford, Illinois; Atlanta, Georgia and Dayton, Ohio) those de- 
fendants normally not eligible for assigned counsel went un- 
represented. 

The need for prompt, individual legal counsel is particularly 
acute in riot situations. This is because of the range of alterna- 
tive charges, the severity of penalties that may -be imposed 
in the heat of riot, the inequities that occur where there is 
mass, indiscriminate processing of arrested persons, and the 
need for essential information when charges are made by the 
prosecutor and bail is set. The services of counsel at the earliest 
stage, preferably at the precinct station, are essential. Provision 
of effective counsel at an early stage will also protect against 
a rash of post-conviction challenges and reversals. 

SENTENCING 

Trial and sentencing proved equally vulnerable to the tyran- 
ny of numbers. Sentences meted out during the riots tended 
to be harsher than in those cases disposed of later. Some judges 
in the early days of the riots openly stated that they would 
impose maximum penalties across-the-board as deterrents. One 
Cincinnati judge announced that any person brought before 
him on a riot-connected offense would receive the maximum 
penalty. Circumstances of the arrest, past record, age, family 
responsibilities or other mitigating factors were not considered. 

The burden of this policy fell on the poorest defendants — 
those unable to raise bail — who agreed to immediate trials. 
Those who could raise bail and wait out the riot often received 
more lenient sentences. Once the riots were over, defendants 
were frequently sentenced to time already spent in detention, if 
they consented to plead guilty. 

In those cities where the riots were less extensive and the 
number of arrests allowed normal trial procedures to remain 
largely intact, sentences did not markedly vary from the norm. 
In Dayton, where most of the 203 law violators were charged 
with minor offenses such as disorderly conduct and destruction 
of property, the standard penalty was a fine of $15 to $50. 
In Rockford, Illinois, where all arrests were for disorderly 
conduct or curfew violations, fines were assessed within a 
$20 to $250 range according to the individual's ability to pay. 

A primary function of criminal justice in a riot situation 
is effectively to apprehend, prosecute and punish the purpose- 
ful inciters to riot, and to assure the community at large- 
rioters and nonrioters alike — that law violators will be prose- 
cuted and sentenced according to an ordered system of justice. 

343 


Dispassionate objectivity on the part of both the bench and 
the bar — always required and always difficult — becomes even 
more necessary when civil disorders occur. The passions of the 
street must not enter the courtroom to affect any step in the 
administration of justice, particularly sentencing. During a 
riot emergency, it is highly important that courts adhere to 
established criteria for sentencing. This did not always occur 
in Detroit and Newark in the summer of 1967. In smaller dis- 
orders, such as Dayton, Atlanta, and New Haven, arrests were 
fewer, arraignments were prompt, release policies were fair and 
sentences were within normal ranges. 

III. Guidelines for the Future 

In a period of civil disorder, it is essential that our judicial 
system continue firmly to protect the individual constitutional 
rights upon which our society is based. 

Our criminal jurisprudence has developed important safe- 
guards based on the arrest process as the mechanism which 
activates the full judicial machinery. Thus, arrest brings into 
play carefully developed procedures for the protection of in- 
dividual rights. 

Some suggest that the judicial system must respond to the 
riot emergency by short-cutting those procedures. Such sug- 
gestions, usually referred to as "preventive arrest" or "preven- 
tive detention,*' involve extending the police power to include 
detention without formal arrest, broadening summary enforce- 
ment procedures, and suspending bail hearings and pre-trial 
procedures for sorting out charges and defendants. 

We reject such suggestions. Rather, we urge each community 
to undertake the difficult but essential task of reform and emer- 
gency planning necessary to give its judicial system the strength 
to meet emergency needs. We make the following recommen- 
dations. 

The Community Should Prepare a Comprehensive Plan for 
Emergency Operation of the Judicial System 

A comprehensive plan for the emergency operation of the 
judicial system during a riot should involve many public and 
private agencies in the community. It must include: 

• A review of applicable statutes and ordinances (and their amend- 
ment and revision if necessary) to ensure that there are well 

344 


drawn, comprehensive laws sufficient to deter and punish the full 
range of riot behavior.11 

• Compilations and interpretations of the laws relied on to control 
such an emergency must be made available to police, prosecutors 
and, through the press, to the community at large well in advance. 
When a disorder arises there must be no doubt what citizens are 
supposed to do and not do. Citizens are more likely to remain 
calm and resist the provocations of unfounded rumors if they are 
already familiar with the laws applicable to riot conditions. 

• Regulatory guidelines should be drawn in advance detailing in- 
teraction of police with other law enforcement personnel {such 
as state police and National Guard), specifying who can make 
arrests and how they should be handled,^ the charges to enter 
for prohibited acts, and how certain minor violations may be 
handled without formal arrest and detention. Booking, screening 
and bail setting will proceed more efficiently when there are 
established guidelines for processing large numbers of cases. 

• Basic policy decisions for each step in the judicial process must 
be made: which charges will become eligible for summons and 
release after arrest, with trial postponed until the emergency is 
over? Will any defendants be released during a riot and on what 
conditions? Which charges require immediate court processing? 
Which charges require an immediate follow-through investigation 
in order to support subsequent prosecution? 

• Bail and sentencing policies applicable during emergencies should 
be defined by the judiciary with consistency and justice as a goal. 
Bail interviewers and probation officers should be instructed as to 
the kind of information required for release or sentencing deci- 
sions in a riot situation. 

• Administrative techniques should be established by the court to 
ensure that eligible indigent defendants' will be represented by 
counsel at the earliest stage. 

• Arrangements for night and weekend court sessions should be 
made. 

• Public and volunteer defenders can be more effectively utilized 
if there are prior allocations to each group of specific classes of 
cases; and if there are agreed procedures for assigning counsel 
to each defendant and for determining how long they will remain 
on the case. For instance, volunteer lawyers may be provided 
to represent riot participants who normally would not be eligible 
to obtain public defenders because of the minor nature of their 

nFor example: it has been suggested that rather than relying on vague 
disorderly conduct or loitering statutes in riot situations, specific laws or ordi- 
nances be enacted which, upon declaration of emergency, deal with possession 
of incendiary devices (even before they are used), interference with police, 
firemen or other emergency workers, storage of firearms, restrictions on access 
to riot areas, restriction on sale of liquor or firearms during emergencies, 
imposition of curfews, and crowd dispersal. Laws designed to meet such 
emergency circumstances must be specific and uniform regarding conditions 
which must exist to invoke their application, who may proclaim such an 
emergency, and what activities or powers such a declaration limits or permits. 
Provision should also be made for judicial review of the invocation of such 
emergency laws. See Supplement on Control of Disorders. 

"During the Detroit riot, processing difliculties arose because National 
Guardsmen, who could not make arrests under state law, handed prisoners over 
to local police without sufficiently recording circumstances of the arrests. 

345 


violations. The entire organized bar of the city and even the state 
— and particularly Negro or other minority members of the bar — 
should be involved in emergency planning. Adequate provision 
must be made for individual counseling of clients in order that 
effective representation does not deteriorate, as it did in many 
cities last summer. There must be training courses in advance to 
ensure that all participating lawyers are prepared for the task. 
Defense strategy on such basic issues as plea negotiation, bail re- 
view, and habeas corpus needs to be planned ahead of time. A 
control center where volunteer lawyers may get advice and in- 
vestigative help during a riot is an essential component of plan- 
ning. 

• Sufficient facilities as near as possible to the court must be found 
to house, in a humane fashion, those detained during riots. Civic 
and service groups have vital roles to play in this aspect of riot 
planning. Temporary detention centers can generate terrible con- 
ditions if proper medical care, communication with the outside, 
food and sanitary facilities are not provided. Juveniles require 
special handling aimed toward early return to their parents. Com- 
munity organizations and volunteers willing to temporarily shel- 
ter or supervise juveniles and adults from the riot area must be 
enlisted, coordinated, and assigned according to plan. 

• Press coverage and impartial observers to report to the com- 
munity on all stages of processing should be provided. Informa- 
tion centers, accessible by a well publicized phone number, must 
be set up to locate defendants promptly and to assure continual 
contact with their families. 

• Emergency planning should also include agreements between dif- 
ferent levels of courts and among courts in different jurisdictions 
to facilitate emergency transfers of judges, prosecutors, and pro- 
bation officers. Where necessary, laws should be passed allowing 
the appointment of members of the bar as special judges during 
such an emergency. Auxiliary courtrooms need to be readied. A 
master list of all competent clerical personnel in the area to help 
process defendants' records quickly is needed. 

We think it probable that a highly visible plan, in which 
basic procedures for handling riots are established and pub- 
licized beforehand, and in which ghetto leaders and citizens 
are full participants, will have a reassuring effect during a dis- 
order. People need to know where they stand — what they can 
and cannot do and what will happen to them if they are 
arrested in a riot situation. 

Prevention is paramount, but experience has shown that 
refusal to plan is foolhardy and can only compound the human 
agonies of civil outbreak. 

The organized bars of our cities and states have a special 
responsibility in planning for the administration of justice dur- 
ing a riot. Their responsibility does not stop with providing 
defense counsel for rioters; they must assist the overloaded 
prosecutors as well. Their participation cannot be confined to 
a small segment — the defense bar or legal aid lawyers — it must 

346 


also include the large law firms, the corporate counselors and 
those who are leaders in the local bar. Lawyers must take 
the lead in showing the community that orderly justice is a 
priority item in any plan for riot prevention and control. 

Recommended Policies in Processing Arrested Persons 

ARRESTS 

Alternatives to arrest. In any riot, the first priority is to 
enforce the law. This may require clearing the streets and 
preventing persons from entering or leaving the riot area. The 
authority of local police and other law enforcement officials 
should be spelled out in carefully drawn laws with a range of 
alternatives to arrest. Persons in the riot area should be per- 
mitted to "move on" or "out" — to go back to their homes 
voluntarily before police resort to arresting them. Discriminat- 
ing use of such options by the police would tend to reduce 
the number of innocent bystanders or minor curfew violators 
picked up, and thereby alleviate congestion of judicial ma- 
chinery.13 

There are other situations during a riot when alternatives 
to arrest and detention may prove useful. One such alternative 
is a summons or notice to appear (like a traffic ticket). It 
may be handed to a citizen on the spot and requires him to 
appear later for processing at the police station or in court 
Situations do arise such as curfew violations or where the 
act of arrest itself threatens to set off a new chain of violence, 
when the police should be given the discretionary power to 
issue on-the-street notices to minor violators. The primary 
advantage of the summons is that it avoids congestion of 
facilities and frees police personnel to remain on the street. 

Guidelines for police discretion to use the summons must 
be drawn up in advance and the police instructed in proper 
exercise of such discretion. The summons will be most useful 
in emergencies if the police are already accustomed to using 
it as a routine law enforcement tool. 

Follow-up in serious arrests. Just as essential as avoiding 
unnecessary arrests is the formulation of special measures to 
ensure the effectiveness of arrests for serious violations. On- 
the-spot photos have been found useful in some jurisdictions. 

18 In Detroit there were 935 adult arrests for curfew violations; 570 in Mil- 
waukee; 335 in New Haven; 95 in Newark; 264 in Watts. A survey of 1,014 
males in Detroit's Jackson Prison who had been arrested for riot offenses 
showed 120 were there for curfew offenses. 

347 


They fix the accused's identity and help to refresh the police 
officer's recollection after he has made scores of arrests for 
different offenses within a matter of hours. 

In the serious case the arresting officer should fill out a 
reasonably detailed incident report as soon as feasible. At the 
station house, serious pffenders might be turned over to a 
special follow-up detail, who can conduct early interrogation, 
check fingerprints and police records, or even revisit the scene 
for additional necessary evidence. Thus, serious cases will be 
separated at the outset for special processing designed to pro- 
duce effective prosecution.14 

POST-ARREST PROCESSING 

Processing facilities. Some experts have suggested that all 
persons arrested during a riot be taken to a central processing 
center, preferably near the court, where available resources 
can most efficiently be used and intelligence activities can be 
coordinated (lawyers and relatives looking for arrested per- 
sons would at least know where to start). Others point out 
that a single location would impose a hardship on residents of 
widely dispersed communities; that neighborhood processing 
centers should be used. A two-step process may be preferable 
— screening for immediate release at the local precinct or 
neighborhood center, with later transportation to a single de- 
tention center for those who are not released or who cannot 
be taken immediately to court. 

The proper choice of single or multiple processing centers 
will be determined by community size, location of available 
facilities in relation to the courts, the dimensions of the dis- 
turbance, and the number of arrested persons. But the facilities 
themselves must be arranged in advance and equipped for 
emergency conversion. Alternate plans may be necessary, since 
many factors cannot be predicted in advance. If multiple de- 
tention or processing centers are used, a central arrest and 
disposition record system is essential, so that prisoners can be 
located by their families and lawyers. The phone number of 
the central information post should be well publicized, and 
the telephone should be manned on a 24-hour basis. In Detroit 
there were nine separate detention centers; in Newark there 

14 Fifty-seven percent of adults booked on felonies in the Watts riots were 
convicted as compared with 72 percent on misdemeanors. A total of 732 were 
given jail sentences, only 36 of which exceeded six months. According to the 
report of the California Bureau of Criminal Statistics "These case dispositions 
have . . . suggested that there was little before the court in the form of 
evidence or positive proof of specific criminal activity." (p. 37)

were five. No centralized arrest record system was maintained. 
Confusion and distress over "lost" persons was widespread. 

Screening for release. The most important function of post- 
arrest screening is promptly to separate different classes of 
offenders so they can be treated on rationally different bases: 
some summoned and released at the station house; some re- 
leased on their own recognizance for later prosecution; some 
held until arraignment and further disposition by a judicial 
officer. It is, therefore, critically important that prosecutors, 
defense counsel, and bail interviewers be present in sufficient 
numbers at the initial processing center. Serious violators ac- 
cused of murder, arson, sniping, aggravated assault, robbery, 
possession of explosives or incitement to riot must be separated 
at this early point, necessary follow-up investigations begun 
and preparations made for prompt presentment in court. Most 
minor offenders swept up in dragnet arrests should be issued 
a summons and released. Curfew offenders or hotheads picked 
up for failure to disperse at the scene, but now cooled down 
and cooperative, might be released without further detention, 
postponing a decision whether later to prosecute. Juveniles 
should be immediately separated for disposition by juvenile 
judges or by probation officers authorized under local law to 
release them to parents or to place them in separate juvenile 
facilities.15 

Between the innocent person and the dangerous offender 
lies a mass of arrestees, brought in on felony charges relating 
to offenses against property — breaking and entering, burglary, 
looting.16 Handling these cases requires broad and sensitive 
discretion. Some looters may be professional thieves syste- 
matically exploiting the riot chaos. Some looters are normally 
law abiding citizens. In Detroit, after the riot had subsided, 
many persons returned looted merchandise. These people usu- 
ally have no significant prior criminal records.17 Although 
prosecution may still be justified, in most instances they may 
safely be released back into the community to pursue their 

16 In the Watts riot, 556 juveniles (14 percent of all arrests) were taken into 
custody: 448 (16 percent) in Newark; 105 (20 percent) in New Haven; 62 
(30 percent) in Dayton; 23 (6 percent) in Cincinnati; 703 (10 percent) in 
Detroit. 

M In Detroit, 84 percent of felony charges were for forms of looting. In 
Watts, 82 percent were arrested on felony charges, most of them "burglary." 

"Statistics on' arrested persons in the Watts riots show that 38 percent had 
no major record (i.e., they had never been sentenced to more than 90 days) 
and 27 percent had no record at all). In Detroit, 51 percent of the arrestees 
had no arrest records. A sample of those arrested on the first day of the riot — 
76 percent for looting — showed 41 percent with no record at all and only 17 
percent with any felony record. In Newark, less than 45 percent of the 
arrestees had any police record.

livelihood and prepare their defense.18 According to prede- 
termined standards agreed upon by police, courts, and prose- 
cutors they should be interviewed promptly for issuance of a 
summons and release at the station house. Where they have 
solid roots in the community,19 and no serious criminal record 
they should be allowed to return to their homes and jobs. The 
station-house summons after arrest might also be reinforced 
by a law providing more severe penalties for those who commit 
new violations while awaiting their court appearances. 

Several cities have had favorable experience in using station- 
house summonses in nonriot situations and in small scale 
demonstrations. This technique, pioneered by the Vera Insti- 
tute of Justice in New York City in conjunction with the New 
York Police Department, permits the police to release defend- 
ants after booking and station-house processing with a sum- 
mons to appear in court at a later time. The summons is 
issued on the basis of information about the defendant — ob- 
tained from an interview and verified only in exceptional cases 
— showing that he has substantial roots in the community and 
is likely to appear for trial. Station-house summonses are now 
used in all New York City precincts and have measurably 
improved police efficiency— an average of five man hours 
saved in every case — while 94 percent of defendants sum- 
moned have appeared voluntarily in court.20 New Haven, 
where the station-house summons was routine under non-riot 
conditions, employed the technique during the riot with notable 

18 It has been pointed out by defense counsel in Detroit that in widespread 
searches in private homes, any new goods found were often confiscated as loot. 
The accused looter's defense would be to produce a bill of sale, or in some 
cases alibi witnesses as to his whereabouts at the time of the alleged looting. 
In either event, the accused was severely prejudiced if he could not return to 
his home or neighborhood before trial. 

19 Analysis of 1,057 convicted Watts arrestees referred for pre-sentence 
reports showed 85 percent lived with family or friends; 73 percent were 
employed; 75 percent had lived in the community five years or more. In 
Jackson State Prison near Detroit, a survey of riot defendants showed 83 per- 
cent charged with some form of breaking, looting, or larceny; 73 percent had 
lived at the same address over a year; 80 percent were employed; 47 percent 
had no arrest record and 67 percent no conviction record. In Detroit 887 
females were arrested, mostly for looting; 74 percent of the females had no 
prior record. Many had young children to care for. The Newark analysis of 
arrestees showed only 10 percent from out of the city. 

20 In its first six months of city-wide operations, New York police issued 
more than 5,500 station-house summonses to about 25 percent of all persons 
arrested for summonsable offenses. The default rate was below 6 percent. The 
police have not issued summonses in some cases of picketing or protests 
because they were able to centrally book and arraign the number involved 
immediately. On the other hand, they cite marked success in summonsing up 
to 100 demonstrators in a school busing protest, and report that "further use 
of the summons process will be made in like instances." 

350 


success. At least 40 percent of all arrestees were released in 
this manner, including some charged with felony offenses. 

Successful employment of this technique requires a corps 
of bail interviewers, and procedures for checking quickly into 
an arrestee's past record.21 It also means providing transporta- 
tion to deliver defendants either back to their homes or to 
shelters outside the riot area. With adequate planning there 
will be a registry of churches, civic organizations, neighbor- 
hood groups, and poverty centers to supervise persons re- 
leased or to provide temporary shelter if necessary. 

In using these procedures at the station house or screening 
center, wide discretion must be left to police and prosecution 
to refuse to summons and release riot participants who appear 
to pose a substantial risk to the community. Persons rear- 
rested after release, for any but the most trivial violations, 
should be disqualified from further summons and release with- 
out judicial sanction. 

The desirability of using defense lawyers in the station- 
house screening process is suggested by the New Haven ex- 
perience. The lawyers can contribute information about the 
defendants; help to make release arrangements; negotiate on 
the charges with the prosecutors and guard against any over- 
charging which would prevent early release; insure that the 
defendants understand their legal rights and the reason for 
cooperation in summons interviews. 

Booking procedures. The ordinary mechanics of booking 
and record keeping must be simplified at the emergency 
screening center. Special techniques must be devised to record 
necessary information about arrestees. The multiple-use form 
devised by the United States Department of Justice for large 
protest demonstrations may provide a prototype. 

Single copies of this form are sent to key points in the 
process through which arrestees pass. One copy is sent to the 

21 During the riots, some cities such as Cincinnati which already had R.O.R. 
programs, suspended them because of the difficulty of identifying and verifying 
information about arrested persons. Other cities such as Dayton continued 
to use the program. In Newark, which began releasing persons in large 
numbers toward the end of the riot, verification of interview information was 
not required. The New York station-house summons program does not ordi- 
narily verify interview information; as a result, the average time expended on 
a summons case is only one hour. While checks of local criminal records might 
be necessary, FBI fingerprint checks delay any release process for a con- 
siderable time, and are not required in present station-house summons pro- 
cedures. In the riot situation, such requirement should be confined to serious 
cases where false identity is strongly suspected. 

The shortage of police trained in identification procedures at the Detroit 
processing centers has been commented upon by the judges there. It has been 
suggested that a list of all such trained ID officers be drawn ahead of time 
for emergency use. Such help is needed so that arrest records, fingerprint 
checks, photo identifications, and other information can be provided quickly 
for use in station-house summons interviews and court bail hearings. 

351 


Bureau of Prisons where a central record of arrested persons 
is kept. Another is sent to the detention center where arrestees 
are taken. The first copy contains all information necessary to 
present a formal charge against a defendant in a hearing be- 
fore a United States Commissioner: defendant's name, basic 
facts of the alleged offense, time and date of the offense, name 
of the arresting officer. 

At the processing station where the arrestee is first detained, 
the arresting officer fills out the form and swears to its facts. 
He is then freed to return immediately to his duty station. A 
notary public is present at the processing station to notarize 
the forms as required by law. 

The arrestee's picture is taken at the time the form is filled 
out if this has not already been done on the scene. The picture 
is attached to a copy of the arrest form. Thus, the arrestee can 
later be identified, even if he refuses to give his name. A docket 
number is also assigned to the case which is used thereafter 
throughout each phase of processing. Docket numbers are 
assigned consecutively. The number of persons arrested can 
thus readily be ascertained. 

The Commission recommends that cities adopt this type of 
form. 

DETENTION AND BAIL SETTING 

Court personnel. For those arrested persons who are not 
considered safe risks for station-house summons and release, 
detention facilities must be provided until such time as they 
can be brought to court for arraignment. By means of extra 
judges and court sessions, arraignments and bail hearings 
should be arranged as quickly as is consistent with individual- 
ized attention.22 

To meet the extraordinary case load encountered during 
riots, judges from courts of record can be asked to volunteer 
for lower court arraignments and bail hearings. Emergency 
plans should provide for service by out-of-town judges, judges 
from other courts, and if necessary specially appointed judges 

28 In many jurisdictions normal processing time will have to be speeded up 
to avoid intolerable congestion. The President's Commission on Law Enforce- 
ment and Administration of Justice recommended as a norm that first court 
appearances follow arrest within hours, with preliminary hearings and formal 
charges three days later for jailed defendants; and that the delay between 
arraignment and trial be no longer than nine weeks. On the other hand, 
jurisdictions which impose maximum time limits on various stages of the 
court process for all defendants may want to provide for relaxation during an 
emergency. As a result of a 10-day preliminary hearing rule in Detroit, 
defendants freed on bail had to be processed as quickly as those detained in 
makeshift facilities. Authorization to handle those detained on a priority basis 
would have alleviated the harsh congestion problem in those facilities. 

352 


sitting on a temporary basis. A statewide prosecutor system — 
another recommendation of the Crime Commission — would 
also be valuable in providing a reserve force of additional 
prosecutors with experience in local and state law. In the 
absence of this flexibility, former prosecutors and private at- 
torneys should be specially deputized and trained in advance 
for emergency service. 

Provision should be made for exchange of court personnel 
among communities in a metropolitan area or in a regional 
council. Authorities might also provide an emergency corps of 
court clerical personnel to move swiftly into riot torn cities 
for immediate service. 

Detention facilities. At the detention centers, teams of de- 
fense lawyers, social workers, interviewers and medical per- 
sonnel should be on hand to gather pertinent information about 
detainees to present to the judge at bail hearings. Defense 
counsel should be prepared to propose reasonable conditions 
for release of each prisoner which will guard against renewal 
of riot activity. 

Bail setting. When the riot defendant comes before the 
court, he should receive an individual determination of bail. 
He should be represented by counsel and the judge should 
ascertain from counsel, client, and bail interviewer the relevant 
facts of his background, age, living arrangements, employ- 
ment, and past record. Uniform bail amounts based on charges 
and riot conditions alone should be shunned as unfair. 

With the constitutional imperatives of bail and pre-convic- 
tion release well in mind, we are fully aware that some rioters, 
if released, will commit new acts of violence. This is an aggra- 
vated extension of a problem which has engaged law enforce- 
ment officials and criminal law authorities for many years. Al- 
though the number of dangerous offenders to be processed, 
even in a riot,23 may not be sizable, how to determine and 
detain them before trial poses a problem of great perplexity. 
The Commission realizes that in riot situations the temptation 
is strong to detain offenders by setting money bail in amounts 
beyond their reach. In the past, such high money bail has been 
indiscriminately set, often resulting in the detention of every- 

28 In the Detroit riot there were seven arrests and three prosecutions for 
homicide; nine arrests and two prosecutions for rape; 108 arrested and 18 
prosecutions for robbery; 206 arrests and 55 prosecutions for assault; 34 
arrests and 13 prosecutions for arson; 28 arrests and six prosecutions for 
inciting to riot; 21 arrests and 18 prosecutions for possessing and placing 
explosives. In Newark there were arrests for one murder, two arsons, 46 
assaults, 91 weapons offenses, and four robberies. In Watts, there were 120 
booked and 60 convicted for aggravated assault, 94 booked and 46 convicted 
for robbery, 27 arrested and seven convicted for arson; seven booked for 
homicide, none convicted and two cases pending. 

353 


one arrested during a riot without distinction as to the nature 
of the alleged crime or the likelihood of repeated offenses. 

The purposes of bail in our system of law have always been 
to prevent confinement before conviction and to insure ap- 
pearance of the accused in court. The purpose has not been to 
deter future crime. Yet some have difficulty adhering to the 
doctrine when it results in releasing a dangerous offender 
back into the riot area. 

We point out that, as to the dangerous offender, there al- 
ready exists a full range of permissible alternatives to outright 
release as a hedge against his reentry into the riot. 

These include: release on conditions of third-party custody; 
forbidding access to certain areas or at certain times; part-time 
release with a requirement to spend nights in jail; use of surety 
or peace bonds on a selective basis.24 In cases where no pre- 
cautions will suffice, trial should be held as soon as possible 
so that a violator can be adjudicated innocent and released 
or found guilty and lawfully confined pending sentencing. 
Finally, special procedures should be set up for expedited bail 
review by higher courts so that defendants' rights will not be 
lost by default. 


RIGHT TO COUNSEL 

The right to counsel is a right to effective counsel. An 
emergency plan should provide that counsel be available at the 
station house to participate in the charging and screening op- 
erations, to provide information for station-house summons 
and release officers and to guard against allegations of brutali- 
ty or fraudulent evidence. All accused persons who are not 
released during post-arrest processing should be represented at 
the bail hearing, whether or not local law provides this as a 
matter of right. During any detention period, defense counsel 
must be able to interview prisoners individually at the deten- 
tion center; privacy must be provided for these lawyer-client 
consultations. 

The number of lawyers needed for this kind of individual 
representation is obviously great, thus furnishing another argu- 
ment for screening out early as many innocent persons and 

84 We are aware that predicating the condition of release upon danger of 
renewed riot activity represents some departure from existing law and may 
also be challenged in the courts. It has, however, been recommended by the 
President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice 
as a preferable alternative to preventive detention. The Challenge of Crime 
in a Free Society—A Report, 1967, pp. 131-2. 

354 


minor offenders as possible, and releasing as many of the rest 
as can be relied upon to create no new disturbance and to re- 
turn for trial. Local bar associations, public defender offices, 
legal aid agencies, neighborhood legal services staffs, rosters 
of court-assigned counsel, law schools and military establish- 
ments are sources of manpower. They can be pre-trained in the 
procedures of an emergency plan and called into volunteer 
service. Assigning one lawyer to a group of defendants should 
be discouraged. If possible, each defendant should have his 
own lawyer ready to follow the case to conclusion. Case quotas 
can be established ahead of time, with teams of lawyers pre- 
pared to take over in relays. Law students can be used as in- 
vestigators and case assistants. Legal defense strategy and 
sources of experienced advice for the volunteers should be 
planned ahead of time. 

Any community plan must make adequate provision for 
fair representation whenever the trials are held, whether dur- 
ing the heat of riot or at a later, more deliberate time. 

There must be no letdown of legal services when trials and 
arraignments are postponed until the riot runs its course. The 
greatest need for counsel may come when the aura of emer- 
gency has dissipated. Volunteers then may be less willing to 
drop their daily obligations to represent riot defendants. If 
this occurs, assembly-line techniques may be resorted to in an 
effort to complete all pending matters cheaply and quickly. 
In one city this letdown had unfortunate results: up to 200 
post-trial arraignments were assigned to one lawyer each day. 
Courtroom "regulars" were given such group assignments in 
preference to the volunteers' more individualized representa- 
tion. 

TRIAL AND SENTENCING 

Important policies are involved in deciding whether judicial 
emphasis during the riot should be placed on immediate trials 
of minor offenders, prompt trials of serious offenders, or ar- 
raignment and bail-setting only. In the case of some serious 
offenders, prompt trials may be the only legal route to de- 
tention. A defendant, however, will often prefer later trial and 
sentencing in the post-riot period, when community tensions 
are eased (if he is not detained during the delay). Witnesses 
may also be difficult to locate and bring to court while riot 
controls are in effect. Arresting officers cannot be easily spared 
from their duty stations. Unprejudiced juries will be difficult 
to empanel. Prosecutors may be more receptive at a later date 
to requests for dismissal, reduction of charges or negotiated 

355 


pleas.25 The most rational allocation of judicial manpower, 
as well as basic fairness, suggests that decisions at such vital 
stages as prosecution, plea negotiation, preliminary examina- 
tion and trials be postponed until the riot is over in all but 
the most minor cases. At the same time, it is necessary to avoid 
congesting the jails and detention centers with masses of 
arrestees who might safely be released. Both can be accom- 
plished only with a workable post-arrest screening process and 
pre-trial release of all except dangerous defendants. 

Trails of minor offenses, involving detained defendants 
should be scheduled quickly, so that pre-conviction confine- 
ment will not stretch jail time beyond authorized penalties. 
Arraignments and bail hearings for those not summoned and 
released at the station house should be held as soon as pos- 
sible. Trials and preliminary examinations of released offen- 
ders can be postponed until the emergency ends, unless the 
defendants pose a present danger to the community. 

Sentencing is often best deferred until the heat of the riot 
has subsided, unless it involves only a routine fine which the 
defendant can afford. Riot defendants should be considered 
individually. They are less likely to be hardened, experienced 
criminals. A pre-sentence report should be prepared in all 
cases where a jail sentence or probation may result. The task 
of imposing penalties for many riot defendants which will 
deter and rehabilitate is a formidable one. A general policy 
should be adopted to give credit on jail sentences for pre- 
conviction detention time in riot cases. 

After the riot is over, a residue of difficult legal tasks will 
remain: proceedings to litigate and compensate for injustices 
— false arrests, physical abuse, property damage — committed 
under the stress of riot;26 actions to expunge arrest records 
acquired without probable cause; restitution policies to en- 
courage looters to surrender goods. Fair, even compassionate, 
attention to these problems will help reduce the legacy of 
post-riot bitterness in the community, 

25 For whatever reasons — policy or evidentiary problems — in the Watts riot, 
43 percent of adult felony arrests and 30 percent of adult misdemeanor arrests 
did not result in convictions. In Detroit, 25 percent of all arrests and 24 per- 
cent of the felony arrests were not prosecuted, including 57 percent of the 
homicide arrests, 74 percent of the aggravated assault arrests, 83 percent of 
the robbery arrests, 43 percent of the stolen property arrests, and 62 percent 
of the arson arrests. Only 29 percent of the curfew arrests were not prose- 
cuted. Reportedly, plea bargaining in Detroit was based almost entirely on a 
defendant's past record. 

* The Newark Legal Services Program reported 29 complaints after the 
riot from ghetto residents concerning personal indignities; 57 about physical 
abuses; 104 about ^discriminate shooting; and 96 about destruction of 
property.

IV. Summary of Recommendations 

The Commission recommends: 

• That communities undertake, as an urgent priority, the reform 
of their lower criminal court systems to insure fair and indi- 
vidual justice for all. The 1967 report of the President's Com- 
mission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice 
provides the blueprint for such reform. 

• That communities formulate a plan for the administration of 
justice in riot emergencies. Under the leadership of the organized 
bar, all segments of the community, including minority groups, 
should be involved in drawing up such a plan. The plan should 
provide clear guidelines for police on when to arrest or use 
alternatives to arrest. Adequate provision must be made for extra 
judges, prosecutors, defense counsel, court and police personnel 
to provide prompt processing, and for well-equipped detention 
facilities. Details of the plan should be publicized so the com- 
munity will know what to expect if an emergency occurs. 

• That existing laws be reviewed to insure their adequacy for 
riot control and the charging of riot offenders, and for authority 
to use temporary outside help in the judicial system. 

• That multiple-use processing forms (such as those used by 
the Department of Justice for mass arrests) be obtained. Cen- 
tralized systems for recording arrests and locations of prisoners 
on current basis should be devised, as well as fast systems to 
check fingerprint identification and past records. On-the-spot 
photographing of riot defendants may also be helpful. 

• That communities adopt station-house summons and release pro- 
cedures (such as are used by the New York City Police Depart- 
ment) in order that they be operational before an emergency 
arises. All defendants who appear likely to return for trial and 
not to engage in renewed riot activity should be summonsed and 
released. 

• That recognized community leaders be admitted to all processing 
and detention centers to avoid allegations of abuse or fraud 
and to reassure the community about the treatment of arrested 
persons. 

• That the bar in each community undertake mobilization of all 
available lawyers for assignment so as to insure early individual 
legal representation to riot defendants through disposition, and 
to provide assistance to prosecutors where needed. Legal defense 
strategies should be planned and volunteers trained in advance. 
Investigative help and experienced advice should be provided. 

• That communities and courts plan for a range of alternative 
conditions to release, such as supervision by civic organizations 
or third party custodians outside the riot area, rather than to 
rely on high money bail to keep defendants off the streets. The 
courts should set bail on an individual basis and provide for 
defense counsel at bail hearings. Emergency procedures for fast 
bail review are needed. 

• That no mass indictments or arraignments be held, and reason- 
able bail and sentences be imposed, both during or after the 
riot. Sentences should be individually considered and pre-sen- 
tence reports required. The emergency plan should provide for 
transfer of probation officers from other courts and jurisdictions 
to assist in the processing of arrestees.

Chapter 14 / Damages: Repair and 
Compensation 

The President, in his charge to the Commission, requested 
advice on the "proper public role in helping cities repair the 
damage" suffered in the recent disorders. 

Damage took many forms. In Detroit alone, 43 persons 
were killed, many of whom were heads of families. Over 600 
persons were injured. Fire destroyed or badly damaged at 
least 100 single and two-family dwellings. Stores of all kinds 
were looted and burned. Hundreds of businesses lost revenue 
by complying with a curfew, and thousands of citizens lost 
wages because businesses were closed. As the riot came to 
an end, streets and sidewalks were strewn with rubble, and 
citizens were imperiled by the shells of burned-out buildings 
verging on collapse. 

In most other disorders, the extent of damage was far less, 
but in almost all, a few persons suffered severe physical or 
financial injury. 

Some of the losses, such as pain and suffering, cannot be 
repaired or compensated. Others are normally handled through 
private insurance. The Commission believes that legislation 
should be enacted to provide fuller assistance to communities 
and to help expand the private insurance mechanism to com- 
pensate individuals for their losses. 

Amending the Federal Disaster Act 

The Federal Government has traditionally played a central 
role in responding to community needs that follow such dis- 
asters as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and earthquakes. Until 
1950, this federal response was accomplished through special 
legislation after each disaster. In 1950, Congress enacted the 
Federal Disaster Act to enable the President, in cases of "major 
disaster," to invoke a broad range of emergency relief and 
repair measures without awaiting special legislation. This Act, 
with subsequent amendments, has, however, been interpreted 
administratively to apply only to natural disasters and not to 
civil disorders. 

The Commission recommends that Congress amend the 
Federal Disaster Act to permit assistance during and follow- 

358 


ing major civil disorders. The hardships to a community can 
be as serious as those following natural catastrophes, and local 
government resources to meet these hardships are likely to be 
inadequate regardless of their cause. 

Applying the Disaster Act to disorders would permit the 
federal government to provide — during the critical period 
while the disorder is still going on or just ending — food, medi- 
cal and hospital supplies, emergency equipment such as beds 
and tents, and temporary shelters and housing. It would also 
permit the loan of equipment and manpower for clearing debris 
and repairing or temporarily replacing damaged public fa- 
cilities. 

In 1967, these necessities were largely provided through the 
prompt and laudable actions of local and state government 
agencies and of private organizations, including churches and 
neighborhood groups.1 Provision for additional help is desir- 
able. Though some food and piedical assistance can now be 
provided by the federal government outside the Disaster Act, 
adequate and comprehensive federal assistance to supplement 
private and local response can be assured only by amending 
the statute. 

Perhaps even more important than the provisions for im- 
mediate response are those that would aid long-term repair. 
In cases of natural disaster, the Disaster Act in its present 
form permits adjustments on many federal loans where fi- 
nancial hardship has resulted to the borrower; gives priority 
status to grant or loan applications for public facilities, public 
housing, and public works; provides grants and matching 
grants for the repair or reconstruction of key public facilities; 
permits low interest loans by the Small Business Administra- 
tion to businesses that have suffered serious economic damage; 
and extends to individuals and businesses tax deductions be- 
yond those normally available for catastrophe losses.2 The Act 
should be amended to make all these kinds of relief available 
following major civil disorders. 

1The kinds of planning recommended at a state and local level to meet 
human needs during the course of a disorder and the coordination of such 
planning with the planning of control forces are considered in the Supplement 
on Control of Disorders, pp. 484 ff. 

2 A few kinds of long-term assistance are already available under acts 
other than the Federal Disaster Act. The Small Business Administration can 
provide long-term loans up to the actual tangible loss suffered by business 
concerns. Loans of this kind were made by SBA in Detroit. The Department 
of Housing and Urban Development is authorized to insure mortgages of 
families in certain low and moderate income housing if it determines that the 
dwelling is situated in an area in which "rioting or other civil disorders" have 
occurred or are threatened and that certain other conditions are satisfied.

Compensating for Individual Losses — Insurance 

In the aftermath of the summer's riots in 1967, insurance 
protection was an important source of security and reim- 
bursement for innocent victims who suffered property damage. 

We believe that a well-functioning private insurance mecha- 
nism is the proper method for paying individuals for losses 
suffered in disorders. Property insurance should be available at 
reasonable cost to residents and businessmen for property in 
reasonable condition regardless of location. If insurance is 
so available, it will function more equitably and efficiently 
to pay riot losses than a program of direct government pay- 
ments to individuals.3 

The private insurance industry can market policies widely 
and collect premiums commensurate with the risks. It can 
develop and recommend loss-prevention techniques and assess 
and pay large numbers of claims on an individual basis. Stand- 
ard property insurance contracts presently include damage 
from civil disorders in their coverage, just as they provide 
compensation for losses due to natural disasters such as fire 
and windstorm. They should continue to do so. 

Early in our deliberations, however, we received many re- 
ports that property insurance was unavailable, or was available 
only at prohibitive cost, in center cities. This did not appear to 
be simply a riot problem but a long-term, pervasive problem 
of center city areas. Since a separate and expert group could 
best examine the problems of the high cost and availability 
of property insurance in center city areas, the President, on 
the Commission's behalf, appointed a National Advisory Panel 
on Insurance in Riot-Affected Areas on August 10, 1967. The 
Panel's work is now complete.4 

The Panel found: 

There is a serious lack of property insurance in the core areas 
ot our nation's cities. For a number of years, many urban resi- 
dents and businessmen have been unable to purchase the in- 
surance protection they need. Now, riots and the threat of riots 
are aggravating the problem to an intolerable degree. Imme- 
diate steps must be taken to make insurance available to re- 
sponsible persons in all areas of our cities. 


8 Over a dozen states have statutes which impose varying degrees of liability 
on municipalities for private losses suffered during disorders. In addition to 
problems posed in litigating claims, it is questionable, given competing needs 
for the limited municipal financial resources, whether these statutes will be 
allowed to continue in force. 

4 The report of the Panel is available from the Superintendent of Documents, 
U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402. 

360 


The Panel also found that: 

The insurance problems created by riots cannot be allowed to 
jeopardize the availability of property insurance in center-city 
areas. But the problem of providing adequate and reasonable 
insurance in the urban core cannot be solved merely by supply- 
ing financial assistance to protect insurance companies against 
catastrophic riot losses. It is clear that adequate insurance was 
unavailable in the urban core even before the riots. We are deal- 
ing with an inner-city insurance problem that is broad in scope and 
complicated in origin, and riots are only one aspect of it. 

In order to assure the availability of property insurance in 
all areas, the Panel recommended a five-part program of mu- 
tually supporting actions to be undertaken immediately by all 
who have a responsibility for solving the problem: 

We call upon the insurance industry to take the lead in estab- 
lishing voluntary plans in all states to assure all property own- 
ers fair access to property insurance. 

We look to the states to cooperate with the industry in establish- 
ing these plans; and to supplement the plans, to whatever ex- 
tent may be necessary, by organizing insurance pools and taking 
other steps to facilitate the insuring of urban core properties. 
We urge that the federal government enact legislation creating 
a National Insurance Development Corporation (NIDC) to 
assist the insurance industry and the states in achieving the 
important goal of providing adequate insurance for inner cities. 
Through the NIDC, the state and federal governments can 
provide backup for the remote contingency of very large riot 
losses. 

We recommend that the federal government enact tax deferral 
measures to increase the capacity of the insurance industry to 
absorb the financial costs of the program. 

We suggest a series of other necessary steps to meet the special 
needs of the inner city insurance market — for example, pro- 
grams to train agents and brokers from the core areas; to as- 
sure the absence of discrimination in insurance company em- 
ployment on racial or other grounds; and to seek out better 
methods of preventing losses and of marketing insurance in 
low-income areas. 

The fundamental thrust of our program is cooperative action. 
Thus, only those companies that participate in plans and pools 
at the local level, and only those states that take action to im- 
plement the program, will be eligible to receive the benefits 
provided by the National Insurance Development Corporation 
and by the federal tax deferral measures. We firmly believe 
that all concerned must work together to meet the urban in- 
surance crisis. Everyone must contribute; no one should escape 
responsibility. 

361 


The Commission endorses the proposals of the Panel and 
recommends they be put into effect by appropriate state and 
federal measures. 


Chapter 15 / The News Media 
and the Disorders 

Introduction 

The President's charge to the Commission asked specifically: 
"What effect do the mass media have on the riots?" 

The question is far reaching and a sure answer is beyond the 
range of presently available scientific techniques. Our conclu- 
sions and recommendations are based upon subjective as well 
as objective factors; interviews as well as statistics; isolated ex- 
amples as well as general trends. 

Freedom of the press is not the issue. A free press is in- 
dispensable to the preservation of the other freedoms this na- 
tion cherishes. The recommendations in this chapter have thus 
been developed under the strong conviction that only a press 
unhindered by government can contribute to freedom. 

To answer the President's question, the Commission: 

• Directed its field survey teams to question government officials, 
law enforcement agents, media personnel, and ordinary citizens 
about their attitudes and reactions to reporting of the riots; 

• Arranged for interviews of media representatives about their 
coverage of the riots; 

• Conducted special interviews with ghetto residents about their 
response to coverage; 

• Arranged for a quantitative analysis of the content of television 
programs and newspaper reporting in 15 riot cities during the 
period of the disorder and the days immediately before and after; 

• From November 10-12, 1967, sponsored and participated in a 
conference of representatives from all levels of the newspaper, 
news magazine, and broadcasting industries at Poughkeepsie, 
New York. 

Finally, of course, the Commissioners read newspapers, 
listened to the radio, watched television, and thus formed their 
own impressions of media coverage. All of these data, im- 
pressions, and attitudes provide the foundation for our conclu- 
sions. 

The Commission also determined, very early, that the answer 
to the President's question did not lie solely in the performance 

362 


of the press and broadcasters in reporting the riots proper. Our 
analysis had to consider also the overall treatment by the media 
of the Negro ghettos, community relations, racial attitudes, 
urban and rural poverty — day by day and month by month, 
year in and year out. 

On this basis, we have reached three conclusions: 

First, that despite instances of sensationalism, inaccuracies, 
and distortions, newspapers, radio and television, on the whole, 
made a real effort to give a balanced, factual account of the 
1967 disorders. 

Second, despite this effort, the portrayal of the violence that 
occurred last summer failed to reflect accurately its scale and 
character. The overall effect was, we believe, an exaggeration 
of both mood and event. 

Third, and ultimately most important, we believe that the 
media have thus far failed to report adequately on the causes 
and consquences of civil disorders and the underlying problems 
of race relations. 

With these comments as a perspective, we discuss first the 
coverage of last summer's disturbances. We will then summa- 
rize our concerns with overall coverage of race relations. 

Coverage of the 1967 Disturbances 

We have found a significant imbalance between what 
actually happened in our cities and what the newspaper, radio, 
and television coverage of the riots told us happened. The 
Commission, in studying last summer's disturbances, visited 
many of the cities and interviewed participants and observers. 
We found that the disorders, as serious as they were, were less 
destructive, less widespread, and less a black-white confronta- 
tion than most people believed. 

Lacking other sources of information, we formed our 
original impressions and beliefs from what we saw on tele- 
vision, heard on the radio, and read in newspapers and maga- 
zines. We are deeply concerned that millions of other Amer- 
icans, who must rely on the mass media, likewise formed 
incorrect impressions and judgments about what went on in 
many American cities last summer. 

As we started to probe the reasons for this imbalance be- 
tween reality and impression, we first believed that the media 
had sensationalized the disturbances, consistently overplaying 
violence and giving disproportionate amounts of time to emo- 
tional events and militant leaders. To test this theory, we 
commissioned a systematic, quantitative analysis, covering the 

363 


content of newspaper and television reporting in 15 cities where 
disorders occurred. The results of this analysis do not support 
our early belief. Of 955 television sequences of riot and racial 
news examined, 837 could be classified for predominant atmos- 
phere as either "emotional," "calm," or "normal." Of these, 
494 were classified as calm, 262 as emotional, and 81 as nor- 
mal. Only a small proportion of all scenes analyzed showed 
actual mob action, people looting, sniping, setting fires, or 
being injured, or killed. Moderate Negro leaders were shown 
more frequently than militant leaders on television news broad- 
casts. 

Of 3,779 newspaper articles analyzed, more focused on 
legislation which should be sought and planning which should 
be done to control ongoing riots and prevent future riots than 
on any other topic. The findings of this content analysis are 
explained in greater detail in Section I. They make it clear that 
the imbalance between actual events and the portrayal of those 
events in the press and on the air cannot be attributed solely to 
sensationalism in reporting and presentation. 

We have, however, identified several factors which, it seems 
to us, did work to create incorrect and exaggerated impressions 
about the scope and intensity of the disorders. 

First, despite the overall statistical picture, there were in- 
stances of gross flaws in presenting news of the 1967 riots. 
Some newspapers printed "scare" headlines unsupported by 
the mild stories that followed. All media reported rumors that 
had no basis in fact. Some newsmen staged "riot' events for 
the cameras. Examples are included in the next section. 

Second, the press obtained much factual information about 
the scale of the disorders — property damage, personal injury, 
and deaths — from local officials, who often were inexperienced 
in dealing with civil disorders and not always able to sort out 
fact from rumor in the confusion. At the height of the Detroit 
riot, some news reports of property damage put the figure in 
excess of $500 million.1 Subsequent investigation shows it to be 
$40 to $45 million.2 

The initial estimates were not the independent judgment of 
reporters or editors. They came from beleaguered government 
officials. But the news media gave currency to these errors. 
Reporters uncritically accepted, and editors uncritically pub- 
lished, the inflated figures, leaving an indelible impression of 

1 As recently as February 9, 1968, an Associated Press dispatch from 
Philadelphia said "damage exceeded $1 billion" in Detroit.

also Meeting the Insurance Crisis of Our Cities, a Report by the President's 
National Advisory Panel on Insurance in Riot-Affected Areas, January, 1968. 

364 


damage up to more than ten times greater than actually oc- 
curred. 

Third, the coverage of the disorders — particularly on tele- 
vision— tended to define the events as black-white confronta- 
tions. In fact almost all of the deaths, injuries and property 
damage occurred in all-Negro neighborhoods, and thus the 
disorders were not "race riots" as that term is generally under- 
stood. 

Closely linked to these problems is the phenomenon of 
cumulative effect. As the summer of 1967 progressed, we think 
Americans often began to associate more or less neutral sights 
and sounds (like a squad car with flashing red lights, a burning 
building, a suspect in police custody) with racial disorders, so 
that the appearance of any particular item, itself hardly in- 
flammatory, set off a whole sequence of association with riot 
events. Moreover, the summer's news was not seen and heard 
in isolation. Events of these past few years — the Watts riot, 
other disorders, and the growing momentum of the civil rights 
movement — conditioned the responses of readers and viewers 
and heightened their reactions. What the public saw and read 
last summer thus produced emotional reactions and left vivid 
impressions not wholly attributable to the material itself. 

Fear and apprehension of racial unrest and violence are 
deeply rooted in American society. They color and intensify 
reactions to news of racial trouble and threats of racial conflict. 
Those who report and disseminate news must be conscious of 
the background of anxieties and apprehension against which 
their stories are projected. This does not mean that the media 
should manage the news or tell less than the truth. Indeed, we 
believe that it would be imprudent and even dangerous to down- 
play coverage in the hope that censored reporting of inflam- 
matory incidents somehow will diminish violence. Once a 
disturbance occurs, the word will spread independently of news- 
papers and television. To attempt to ignore these events or 
portray them as something other than what they are, can only 
diminish confidence in the media and increase the effectiveness 
of those who monger rumors and the fears of those who listen. 

But to be complete, the coverage must be representative. We 
suggest that the main failure of the media last summer was that 
the totality of its coverage was not as representative as it should 
have been to be accurate. We believe that to live up to their 
own professed standards, the media simply must exercise a 
higher degree of care and a greater level of sophistication than 

365 


they have yet shown in this area — higher, perhaps, than the 
level ordinarily acceptable with other stories. 

This is not "just another story." It should not be treated like 
one. Admittedly, some of what disturbs us about riot coverage 
last summer stems from circumstances beyond media control. 
But many of the inaccuracies of fact, tone and mood were due 
to the failure of reporters and editors to ask tough enough 
questions about official reports, and to apply the most rigor- 
ous standards possible in evaluating and presenting the news. 
Reporters and editors must be sure that descriptions and pic- 
tures of violence, and emotional or inflammatory sequences or 
articles, even though "true" in isolation, are really representa- 
tive and do not convey an impression at odds with the overall 
reality of events. The media too often did not achieve this 
level of sophisticated, skeptical, careful news judgment during 
last summer's riots. 

The Media and Race Relations 

Our second and fundamental criticism is that the news 
media have failed to analyze and report adequately on racial 
problems in the United States and, as a related matter, to meet 
the Negro's legitimate expectations in journalism. By and 
large, news organizations have failed to communicate to both 
their black and white audiences a sense of the problems Amer- 
ica faces and the sources of potential solutions. The media 
report and write from the standpoint of a white man's world. 
The ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro's 
burning sense of grievance, are seldom conveyed. Slights and 
indignities are part of the Negro's daily life, and many of them 
come from what he now calls "the white press" — a press that 
repeatedly, if unconsciously, reflects the biases, the paternalism, 
the indifference of white America. This may be understandable, 
but it is not excusable in an institution that has the mission to 
inform and educate the whole of our society. 

Our criticisms, important as they are, do not lead us to 
conclude that the media are a cause of riots, any more than 
they are the cause of other phenomena which they report. It is 
true that newspaper and television reporting helped shape 
people's attitudes toward riots. In some cities people who 
watched television reports and read newspaper accounts of 
riots in other cities later rioted themselves. But the causal chain 
weakens when we recall that in other cities, people in very 
much the same circumstances watched the same programs and 
read the same newspaper stories but did not riot themselves. 

366 


The news media are not the sole source of information and 
certainly not the only influence on public attitudes. People ob- 
tained their information and formed their opinions about the 
1967 disorders from the multiplicity of sources that condition 
the public's thinking on all events. Personal experience, conver- 
sations with others, the local and long-distance telephone are 
all important as sources of information and ideas and con- 
tribute to the totality of attitudes about riots. 

No doubt, in some cases, the knowledge or the sight on a 
television screen of what had gone on elsewhere lowered in- 
hibitions or kindled outrage or awakened desires for excite- 
ment or loot — or simply passed the word. Many ghetto resi- 
dents we interviewed thought so themselves. By the same 
token, the news reports of riots must have conditioned the 
response of officials and police to disturbances in their own 
cities. The reaction of the authorities in Detroit was almost 
certainly affected in some part by what they saw or read of 
Newark a week earlier. The Commission believes that none of 
these private or official reactions was decisive in determining 
the course of the disorders. Even if they had been more signifi- 
cant than we think, however, we cannot envision a system of 
governmental restraints that could successfully eliminate these 
effects. And an effort to formulate and impose such restraints 
would be inconsistent with fundamental traditions in our 
society. 

The failings of the media must be corrected and the im- 
provement must come from within the media. A society that 
values and relies on a free press as intensely as ours, is entitled 
to demand in return responsibility from the press and con- 
scientious attention by the press to its own deficiencies. The 
Commission has seen evidence that many of those who super- 
vise, edit, and report for the news media are becoming increas- 
ingly aware of and concerned about their performance in this 
field. With that concern, and with more experience, will come 
more sophisticated and responsible coverage. But much more 
must be done, and it must be done soon. 

The Commission has a number of recommendations de- 
signed to stimulate and accelerate efforts toward self-improve- 
ment. And we propose a privately organized, privately funded 
Institute of Urban Communications as a means for draw- 
ing these recommendations together and promoting their 
implementation.

I. News Coverage of Civil Disorders — 
Summer 1967 

The Method of Analysis 

As noted, the Commission has been surveying both the re- 
porting of disorders last summer and the broader field of race 
relations coverage. With respect to the reporting of disorders, 
we were trying to get a sense of content, accuracy, tone, and 
bias. We sought to find out how people reacted to it and how 
reporters conducted themselves while carrying out their assign- 
ments. The Commission used a number of techniques to 
probe these matters and to provide cross checks on data and 
impressions. 

To obtain an objective source of data, the Commission ar- 
ranged for a systematic, quantitative analysis of the content 
of newspapers, local television, and network coverage in 15 
cities for a period from three days before to three days after 
the disorder in each city.3 

The cities were chosen to provide a cross-section in terms of 
the location and scale of the disorders and the dates of their 
occurrence. 

Within each city, for the period specified, the study was 
comprehensive. Every daily newspaper and all network and 
local television news films were analyzed, and scripts and logs 
were examined. In all, 955 network and local television se- 
quences and 3,779 newspaper articles dealing with riot and 
race relations news were analyzed. Each separate analysis was 
coded and the cards were cross-tabulated by computer to pro- 
vide results and comparisons for use by the Commission. The 
material was measured to determine the amount of space 
devoted to news of riot activity; the nature of the display 
given compared with other news coverage; and the types of 
stories, articles, and television programming presented. We 
sought specific statistical information on such matters as the 
amount of space or time devoted to different kinds of riot 
stories, the types and identities of persons most often depicted 
or interviewed, the frequency with which race relations prob- 
lems were mentioned in riot stories or identified as the cause 
of riot activity. 

The survey was designed to be objective and statistical. 

8 Detroit, Michigan; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Cincinnati, Ohio; Dayton, 
Ohio; Tampa, Florida; Newark, New Jersey; Plainfield, New Jersey; Elizabeth, 
New Jersey; Jersey City, New Jersey; East Orange, New Jersey; Paterson, 
New Jersey; New Brunswick, New Jersey; Englewood, New Jersey; New Haven, 
Connecticut; Rochester, New York. 

368 


Within its terms of reference, the Commission was looking for 
broad characterizations of media tone and content. 

The Commission is aware of the inherent limitations of 
content analysis techniques. They cannot measure the emo- 
tional impact of a particular story or television sequence. By 
themselves, they provide no basis for conclusions as to the 
accuracy of what was reported. Particular examples of good 
or bad journalistic conduct, which may be important in them- 
selves, are submerged in a statistical average. The Commission 
therefore sought through staff interviews and personal contact 
with members of the press and the public to obtain direct evi- 
dence of the effects of riot coverage and the performance of 
the media during last summer's disturbances. 

Conclusions About Content* 

TELEVISION 

1. Content analysis of television film footage shows that the 
tone of the coverage studied was more "calm" and "factual" 
than "emotional" and "rumor-laden." Researchers viewed 
every one of the 955 television sequences and found that twice 
as many "calm" sequences as "emotional" ones were shown. 
The amount and location of coverage were relatively limited, 
considering the magnitude of the events. The analysis reveals 
a dominant, positive emphasis on control of the riot and on 
activities in the aftermath of the riot (53.8 percent of all 
scenes broadcast) rather than on scenes of actual mob ac- 
tion, or people looting, sniping, setting fires, or being injured 
or killed (4.8 percent of scenes shown). According to parti- 
cipants in our Poughkeepsie conference, coverage frequently 
was of the postriot or interview variety because newsmen 
arrived at the scene after the actual violence had subsided. 
Overall, both network and local television coverage was cau- 
tious and restrained. 

2. Television newscasts during the periods of actual disorder 
in 1967 tended to emphasize law enforcement activities, there- 
by overshadowing underlying grievances and tensions. This 
conclusion is based on the relatively high frequency with which 
television showed and described law enforcement agents, 
police, national guardsmen, and army troops performing con- 
trol functions. 

Television coverage tended to give the impression that the 
riots were confrontations between Negroes and whites rather 
than responses by Negroes to underlying slum problems. The 

*What follows is a summary of the major conclusions drawn from the 
content analysis conducted for the Commission. 

369 


control agents were predominantly white. The ratio of white 
male adults5 to Negro male adults shown on television is high 
(1:2) considering that the riots took place in predominantly 
Negro neighborhoods. And some interviews with whites in- 
volved landlords or proprietors who had lost property or 
suffered business losses because of the disturbances and thus 
held strongly antagonistic attitudes. 

The content analysis shows that by far the most frequent 
"actor" appearances on television were Negro male adults, 
white male adults, law enforcement agents, and public officials. 
We cannot tell from a content analysis whether there was any 
preconceived editorial policy of portraying the riots as racial 
confrontations requiring the intervention of enforcement 
agents. But the content analysis does present a visual three-way 
alignment of Negroes, white bystanders, and public officials or 
enforcement agents. This alignment tended to create an im- 
pression that the riots were predominantly racial confronta- 
tions between black and white citizens. 

3. About one-third of all riot-related sequences for network 
and local television appeared on the first day following the 
outbreak of rioting, regardless of the course of development of 
the riot itself. After the first day there was, except in Detroit, 
a very sharp decline in the amount of television time devoted 
to the disturbance. In Detroit, where the riot started slowly 
and did not flare out of control until the evening of July 24, 
48 hours after it started, the number of riot-related sequences 
shown increased until July 26, and then showed the same sharp 
drop-off as noted after the first day of rioting in the other 
cities.6 These findings tend to controvert the impression that 
the riot intensifies television coverage, thus in turn intensifying 
the riot. The content analysis indicates that whether or not 
the riot was getting worse, television coverage of the riot 
decreased sharply after the first day. 

4. The Commission made a special effort to analyze tele- 
vision coverage of Negro leaders. To do this, Negro leaders 
were divided into three categories: (a) celebrities or public 
figures, who did not claim any organizational following (e.g., 
social scientist Dr. Kenneth B. Clark, comedian Dick Greg- 
ory); (b) "moderate" Negro leaders, who claim a political or 
organizational following; and (c) "militant" Negro leaders 
who claim a political or organizational following. During the 
riot periods surveyed, Negro leaders appeared infrequently on 

6 The white male adult category in this computation does not include law 
enforcement agents or public officials. 

0 Detroit news outlets substantially refrained from publicizing the riot 
during the early part of Sunday, the first day of rioting. 

370 


network news broadcasts and were about equally divided 
among celebrity or public figures, moderate leaders, and mili- 
tant leaders. On local television, Negro leaders appeared more 
often. Of the three categories, "moderate" Negro leaders were 
shown on local stations more than twice as often as Negro 
leaders identified primarily as celebrities or public figures, and 
three times more frequently than militant leaders. 

NEWSPAPERS 

1. Like television coverage, newspaper coverage of civil 
disturbances in the summer of 1967 was more calm, factual 
and restrained than outwardly emotional or inflammatory. 
During the period of the riot there were many stories dealing 
exclusively with nonriot racial news. Considering the magni- 
tude of the events, the amount of coverage was limited. Most 
stories were played down or put on inside pages. Researchers 
found that almost all the articles analyzed (3,045 of 3,770) 
tended to focus on one of 16 identifiable subjects. Of this group, 
502 articles (16.5 percent) focused primarily on legislation 
which should be sought and planning which could be done to 
control ongoing riots and prevent future riots. The second 
largest category consisted of 471 articles (15.5 percent) focus- 
ing on containment or control of riot action. Newspaper cov- 
erage of the disorders reflects efforts at caution and restraint. 

2. Newspapers tended to characterize and portray last sum- 
mer's riots in national terms rather than as local phenomena 
and problems, especially when rioting was taking place in the 
newspaper's own city. During the actual disorders, the news- 
papers in each city studied tended to print many stories dealing 
with disorders or racial troubles in other cities. About 40 per- 
cent of the riot or racial stories in each local newspaper during 
the period of rioting in that city came from the wire services. 
Furthermore, most newspaper editors appear to have given 
more headline attention to riots occurring elsewhere than to 
those at home during the time of trouble in their own cities. 

Accuracy of the Coverage 

We have tested the accuracy of coverage by means of inter- 
views with local media representatives, city and police officials, 
and residents of the ghettos. To provide a broad base, we used 
three separate sources for interview data: the Commission's 
field survey teams, special field teams, and the findings of a 
special research study. 

As is to be expected, almost everyone had his own version 

371 


of "the truth," but it is noteworthy that some editors and re- 
porters themselves, in retrospect, have expressed concern about 
the accuracy of their own coverage. For example, one news- 
paper editor said at the Commission's Poughkeepsie confer- 
ence: 

We used things in our leads and headlines during the riot I wish 
we could have back now, because they were wrong and they 
were bad mistakes . . . We used the words "sniper kings'* and 
"nests of snipers." We found out when we were able to get our 
people into those areas and get them out from under the cars 
that these sniper kings and these nests of snipers were the con- 
stituted authorities shooting at each other, most of them. There 
was just one confirmed sniper in the entire eight-day riot and 
he was . . . drunk and he had a pistol, and he was firing from 
a window. 

Television industry representatives at the conference stressed 
their concern about "live" coverage of disorders and said they 
try, whenever possible, to view and edit taped or filmed se- 
quences before broadcasting them. Conference participants 
admitted that live television coverage via helicopter of the 1965 
Watts riot had been inflammatory, and network news execu- 
tives expressed doubts that television would ever again present 
live coverage of a civil disorder. 

Most errors involved mistakes of fact, exaggeration of 
events, overplaying of particular stories, or prominently dis- 
played speculation about unfounded rumors of potential trou- 
ble. This is not only a local problem; because of the wire serv- 
ices and networks, it is a national one. An experienced riot 
reporter told the Commission that initial wire service reports 
of a disturbance tend to be inflated. The reason, he said, is 
that they are written by local bureau men who in most cases 
have not seen a civil disorder before. When out-of-town re- 
porters with knowledge in the field, or the wire services' own 
riot specialists arrive on the scene, the situation is put into a 
more accurate context. 

Some examples of exaggeration and mistakes about facts 
are catalogued here. These examples are by no means exhaus- 
tive. They represent only a few of the incidents discovered by 
the Commission and, no doubt, are but a small part of the total 
number of such inaccuracies. But the Commission believes 
that they are representative of the kinds of errors likely to 
occur when, in addition to the confusion inherent in civil dis- 
order situations, reporters are rushed and harried or editors 
are superficial and careless. We present these as examples of 
mistakes that we hope will be avoided in the future. 

In particular, we believe newsmen should be wary of how 

372 


they play rumors of impending trouble. Whether a rumor is 
reliable and significant enough to deserve coverage is an edi- 
torial decision. But the failure of many headlined rumors to 
be borne out last summer suggests that these editorial deci- 
sions often are not as carefully made as the sensitivity of the 
subject requires. 

• In Detroit, a radio station broadcast a rumor, based on a tele- 
phone tip, that Negroes planned to invade suburbia one night 
later; if plans existed, they never materialized. 

• In Cincinnati, several outlets ran a story about white youths 
arrested for possessing a bazooka; only a few reports mentioned 
that the weapon was inoperable. 

• In Tampa a newspaper repeatedly indulged in speculation about 
impending trouble. When the state attorney ruled the fatal 
shooting of a Negro youth justifiable homicide, the paper's 
news columns reported: "There were fears today that the ruling 
would stir new race problems for Tampa tonight." The day 
before, the paper quoted one "top lawman" as telling reporters 
"he now fears that Negro residents in the Central Avenue 
Project and in the West Tampa trouble spots feel they are in 
competition, and are trying to see which can cause the most 
unrest — which area can become the center of attraction." 

• A West Coast newspaper put out an edition headlined: "Riot- 
ing Erupts in Washington, D.C. / Negroes Hurl Bottles, Rocks 
at Police Near White House." The story did not support the 
headline. It reported what was actually the fact: that a number 
of teenage Negroes broke store windows and threw bottles and 
stones at police and firemen near downtown Washington, a mile 
or more from the White House. On the other hand, the same 
paper did not report unfounded local rumors of sniping when 
other news media did. 

Television presents a different problem with respect to accu- 
racy. In contrast to what some of its critics have charged, tele- 
vision sometimes may have leaned over too far backward in 
seeking balance and restraint. By stressing interviews, many 
with whites in predominantly Negro neighborhoods, and by 
emphasizing control scenes rather than riotous action, tele- 
vision news broadcasts may have given a distorted picture of 
what the disorders were all about. 

The media — especially television — also have failed to pre- 
sent and analyze to a sufficient extent the basic reasons for the 
disorders. There have, after the disorders, been some brilliant 
exceptions.7 As the content analysis findings suggest, however, 

7 As examples, less than a month after the Detroit riot, the Detroit Free 
Press published the results of a landmark survey of local Negro attitudes and 
grievances. Newsweek Magazine's November 20, 1967 special issue on "The 
Negro American — What Must Be Done" made a significant contribution to 
public understanding. 

373 


coverage during the riot period itself gives far more emphasis 
to control of rioters and black-white confrontation than to the 
underlying causes of the disturbances. 

Ghetto Reactions to the Media Coverage 

The Commission was particularly interested in public reac- 
tion to media coverage; specifically, what people in the ghetto 
look at and read and how it affects them. The Commission has 
drawn upon reports from special teams of researchers who 
visited various cities where outbreaks occurred last summer. 
Members of these teams interviewed ghetto dwellers and mid- 
dle-class Negroes on their responses to news media. In addition, 
we have used information from a statistical study of the mass 
media in the Negro ghetto in Pittsburgh.8 

These interviews and surveys, though by no means a com- 
plete study of the subject, lead to four broad conclusions about 
ghetto, and to a lesser degree middle-class Negro, reactions 
to the media. 

Most Negroes distrust what they refer to as the "white 
press." As one interviewer reported: 

The average black person couldn't give less of a damn about 
what the media say. The intelligent black person is resentful 
at what he considers to be a totally false portrayal of what goes 
on in the ghetto. Most black people see the newspapers as 
mouthpieces of the "power structure." 

These comments are echoed in most interview reports the 
Commission has read. Distrust and dislike of the media among 
ghetto Negroes encompass all the media, though in general, 
the newspapers are mistrusted more than the television. This 
is not because television is thought to be more sensitive or 
responsive to Negro needs and aspirations, but because ghetto 
residents believe that television at least lets them see the actual 
events for themselves. Even so, many Negroes, particularly 
teenagers, told researchers that they noted a pronounced dis- 
crepancy between what they saw in the riots and what tele- 
vision broadcast. 

Persons interviewed offered three chief reasons for their 
attitude. First, they believed, as suggested in the quotation 
above, that the media are instruments of the white power 
structure. They thought that these white interests guide the 
entire white community, from the journalists' friends and 
neighbors to city officials, police officers, and department store

document on Mass Media Use Patterns and Functions in the Negro Ghetto 
in Pittsburgh.

owners. Publishers and editors, if not white reporters, sup- 
ported and defended these interests with enthusiasm and 
dedication. 

Second, many people in the ghettos apparently believe that 
newsmen rely on the police for most of their information 
about what is happening during a disorder and tend to report 
much more of what the officials are doing and saying than 
what Negro citizens or leaders in the city are doing and saying. 
Editors and reporters at the Poughkeepsie conference acknowl- 
edged that the police and city officials are their main — and 
sometimes their only — source of information. It was also noted 
that most reporters who cover civil disturbances tend to ar- 
rive with the police and stay close to them — often for safety, 
and often because they learn where the action is at the same 
time as the authorities — and thus buttress the ghetto impres- 
sion that police and press work together and toward the same 
ends (an impression that may come as a surprise to many 
within the ranks of police and press). 

Third, Negro residents in several cities surveyed cited as 
specific examples of media unfairness what they considered 
the failure of the media: 

• To report the many examples of Negroes helping law enforce- 
ment officers and assisting in the treatment of the wounded 
during disorders; 

• To report adequately about false arrests; 

• To report instances of excessive force by the National Guard; 

• To explore and interpret the background conditions leading to 
disturbances; 

• To expose, except in Detroit, what they regarded as instances of 
police brutality; 

• To report on white vigilante groups which allegedly came into 
some disorder areas and molested innocent Negro residents. 

Some of these problems are insoluble. But more first-hand 
reporting in the diffuse and fragmented riot area should temper 
easy reliance on police information and announcements. There 
is a special need for news media to cover "positive" news 
stories in the ghetto before and after riots with concern and 
enthusiasm. 

A multitude of news and information sources other than 
the established news media are relied upon in the ghetto. One 
of our studies found that 79 percent of a total of 567 ghetto 
residents interviewed in seven cities9 first heard about the out- 
break in their own city by word of mouth. Telephone and 
word of mouth exchanges on the streets, in churches, stores, 
pool halls, and bars, provide more information — and rumors —

about events of direct concern to ghetto residents than the 
more conventional news media. 

Among the established media, television and radio are far 
more popular in the ghetto than newspapers. Radios there* 
apparently, are ordinarily listened to less for news than for 
music and other programs. One survey showed that an over- 
whelmingly large number of Negro children and teenagers 
(like their white counterparts) listen to the radio for music 
alone, interspersed by disc jockey chatter. In other age groups, 
the response of most people about what they listen to on the 
radio was "anything," leading to the conclusion that radio 
in the ghetto is basically a background accompaniment. 

3ut the fact that radio is such a constant background ac- 
companiment can make it an important influence on people's 
attitudes, and perhaps on their actions once trouble develops. 
This is true for several reasons.  News presented on local 
"rock" stations seldom constitutes much more than terse head- 
line items which may startle or frighten but seldom inform. 
Radio disc jockeys and those who preside over the popular 
"talk shows" keep a steady patter of information going ovet r 
the air. When a city is beset by civil strife, this patter can both 
inform transistor radio-carrying young people where the ac- 
tions is, and terrify their elders and much of the white com- j 
munity. "Burn, baby, burn," the slogan of the Watts riot, was i 
inadvertently originated by a radio disc jockey. 

Thus, radio can be an instrument of trouble and tension i 
in a community threatened or inundated with civil disorder. , 
It can also do much to minimize fear by putting fast-paced I 
events into proper perspective. We have found commendable 
instances,  for  example,  in  Detroit,  Milwaukee,  and  New 
Brunswick, of radio stations and personalities using their air 
time and influence to try to calm potential rioters. In Section j 
II, we recommend procedures for meetings and consultations 
for advance planning among those who will cover civil dis- 
orders. It is important that radio personnel, and especially 
disc jockeys and talk show hosts, be included in such pre- 
planning. 

Television is the formal news source most relied upon in 
the ghetto. According to one report, more than 75 percent 
of the sample turned to television for national and interna- 
tional news, and a larger percentage of the sample (86 per- 
cent) regularly watched television from 5 to 7 p.m., the din- 
ner hours when the evening news programs are broadcast 

The significance of broadcasting in news dissemination is 
seen in Census Bureau estimates that in June 1967, 87.7 per- 
cent of nonwhite households and 94.8 percent of white house- 
holds had television sets. 

376 


When ghetto residents do turn to newspapers, most read 
tabloids, if available, far more frequently than standard size 
newspapers and rely on the tabloids primarily for light fea- 
tures, racing charts, comic strips, fashion news and display 
advertising. 

Conduct of Press Representatives 

Most newsmen appear to be aware and concerned that their 
very physical presence can exacerbate a small disturbance, but 
some have conducted themselves with a startling lack of 
common sense. News organizations, particularly television 
networks, have taken substantial steps to minimize the effect 
of the physical presence of their employees at a news event. 
| Networks have issued internal instructions calling for use of 
unmarked cars and small cameras and tape recorders, and 
most stations instruct their cameramen to film without arti- 
ficial light whenever possible. Still, some newsmen have done 
things "for the sake of the story" that could have contributed 
to tension. 

Reports have come to the Commission's attention of in- 
dividual newsmen staging events, coaxing youths to throw 
rocks and interrupt traffic, and otherwise acting irresponsibly 
at the incipient stages of a disturbance. Such acts are the re- 
sponsibility of the news organization as well as of its indi- 
vidual reporter. 

Two examples occurred in Newark. Television cameramen, 
according to officials, crowded into and in front of police 
headquarters, interfering with law enforcement operations and 
"making a general nuisance of themselves." In a separate 
incident, a New York newspaper photographer covering the 
Newark riot repeatedly urged and finally convinced a Negro 
boy to throw a rock for the camera. Crowding may occasionally 
be unavoidable; staging of events is not. 

We believe every effort should be made to eliminate this 
sort of conduct. This requires the implementation of thought- 
ful, stringent staff guidelines for reporters and editors. Such 
guidelines, carefully formulated, widely disseminated, and 
strictly enforced, underlie the self-policing activities of some 
news organizations already, but they must be universally 
adopted if they are to be effective in curbing journalistic ir- 
responsibility. 

The Commission has studied the internal guidelines in use 
last summer at the Associated Press, United Press Interna- 
tional, the Washington Post, and the Columbia Broadcasting 
System. Many other news organizations, large and small, have 
similar guidelines. In general, the guidelines urge extreme care 

377 


to ensure that reporting is thorough and balanced and that 
words and statistics used are appropriate and accurate. The 
AP guidelines call for broad investigation into the immediate 
and underlying causes of an incident. The CBS guidelines de- 
mand as much caution as possible to avoid the danger of 
camera equipment and lights exacerbating the disturbance. 

Internal guidelines can, and all those studied do, go beyond 
problems of physical presence at a disturbance to the sub- 
stantive aspects of searching out, reporting, and writing the 
story. But the content of the guidelines is probably less im- 
portant than the fact that the subject has been thoughtfully 
considered and hammered out within the organization, and 
an approach developed that is designed to meet the organiza- 
tion's particular needs and solve its particular problems. 

We recommend that every news organization that does not 
now have some form of guidelines— or suspects that those 
it has are not working effectively — designate top editors to 
(a) meet with its reporters who have covered or might be 
assigned to riots, (b) discuss in detail the problems and pro- 
cedures which exist or are expected and (c) formulate and 
disseminate directives based on the discussions. Regardless 
of the specific provisions, the vital step is for every news- 
gathering organization to adopt and implement at least some 
minimal form of internal control, 

n. A Recommendation to Improve Riot Coverage 

A Need for Better Communication 

A recurrent problem in the coverage of last summer's dis- 
orders was friction and lack of cooperation between police 
officers and working reporters. Many experienced and capable 
journalists complained that policemen and their commanding 
officers were at best apathetic and at worst overtly hostile 
toward reporters attempting to cover a disturbance. Policemen, 
on the other hand, charged that many reporters seemed to 
forget that the task of the police is to restore order. 

After considering available evidence on the subject, the 
Commission is convinced that these conditions reflect an ab- 
sence of advance communication and planning among the 
people involved. We do not suggest that familiarity with the 
other's problems will beget total amity and cooperation. The 
interests of the media and the police are sometimes necessarily 
at variance. But we do believe that communication is a vital 
step toward removing the obstacles produced by ignorance, 
confusion, and misunderstanding of what each group is actu- 
ally trying to do. 

378 


Mutual Orientation 

What is needed first is a series of discussions, perhaps a 
combination of informal gatherings and seminar-type work- 
shops. They should encompass all ranks of the police, all levels 
of media employees, and a cross-section of city officials. At 
first these would be get-acquainted sessions — to air complaints 
and discuss common problems. Working reporters should get 
to know the police who would be likely to draw duty in a 
disorder. Police and city officials should use the sessions for 
frank and candid briefings on the problems the city might face 
and official plans for dealing with disturbances. 

Later sessions might consider procedures to facilitate the 
physical movement of personnel and speed the flow of accurate 
and complete news. Such arrangements migjit involve nothing 
more than a procedure for designating specific locations at 
which police officers would be available to escort a reporter 
into a dangerous area. In addition, policemen and reporters 
working together might devise better methods of identification, 
communication, and training. 

Such procedures are infinitely variable and depend on the 
initiative, needs, and desires of those involved. If there is no 
existing institution or procedure for convening such meetings, 
we urge the mayor or city manager to do so in every city 
where experience suggests the possibility of future trouble. 
To allay any apprehension that discussions with officials might 
lead to restraints on the freedom to seek out and report the 
news, participants in these meetings should stipulate before- 
hand that freedom of access to all areas for reporters will be 
preserved. 

Designation of Information Officers 

It is desirable to designate and prepare a number of police 
officers to act as media information officers. There should be 
enough of these so that, in the event of a disturbance, a re- 
porter will not have to seek far to find a policeman ready and 
able to give him information and answer questions. Officers 
should be of high enough rank within the police department 
to have ready access to information. 

Creation of Central Information Center 

A nerve center for reliable police and official government 
information should be planned and ready for activation when 

379 


a disturbance reaches a predetermined point of intensity. Such 
a center might be located at police headquarters or city hall. 
It should be directed by an experienced, high-ranking infor- 
mation specialist with close ties to police officials. It is im- 
perative, of course, that all officials keep a steady flow of 
accurate information coming into the center. Ideally, rooms 
would be set aside for taping and filming interviews with 
public officials. Local television stations might cut costs and 
relieve congestion by pooling some equipment at this central 
facility. An information center should not be thought of as 
replacing other news sources inside and outside the disturbance 
area. If anything, our studies suggest that reporters are al- 
ready too closely tied to police and officials as news sources 
in a disorder. An information center should not be permitted 
to intensify this dependence. Properly conceived, however, a 
center can supplement on-the-spot reporting and supply news 
about official action. 

Out-of-Town Reporters 

Much of the difficulty last summer apparently revolved 
around relations between local law enforcement officials and 
out-of-town reporters. These reporters are likely to be less 
sensitive about preserving the "image" of the local community. 

Still, local officials serve their city badly when they ignore 
or impede national media representatives instead of welcoming 
them, informing them about the city, and cooperating with 
their attempts to cover the story. City and police officials 
should designate liaison officers and distribute names and tele- 
phone numbers of police and other relevant officials, the place 
they can be found if trouble develops, and other information 
likely to be useful. 

National and other news organizations, in turn, could help 
matters by selecting a responsible home office official to act 
as liaison in these cases and to be accessible by phone to local 
officials who encounter difficulty with on-the-spot representa- 
tives of an organization. 

General Guidelines and Codes 

In some cases, if all parties involved were willing, planning 
sessions might lead to the consideration of more formal under- 
takings. These might include: (a) agreements on specific pro- 
cedures to expedite the physical movement of men and equip- 
ment around disorder areas and back and forth through police 
lines; (b) general guidelines on the behavior of both media 
and police personnel, and (c) arrangements for a brief mor- 

380 


atorium on reporting news of an incipient disturbance. The 
Commission stresses once again its belief that though each of 
these possibilities merits consideration, none should be formu- 
lated or imposed by unilateral government action. Any pro- 
cedure finally adopted should be negotiated between police 
and media representatives and should assure both sides the 
flexibility needed to do their respective jobs. Acceptance of 
such arrangements should be frankly based on grounds of 
self-interest, for negotiated methods of procedure can often 
yield substantial benefits to each side — and to the public which 
both serve. 

At the request of the Commission, the Community Relations 
Service of the Department of Justice surveyed recent experi- 
ences with formal codes. Most of the codes studied: (a) set 
forth in general terms common sense standards of good jour- 
nalistic conduct, and (b) establish procedures for a brief 
moratorium (seldom more than 30 minutes to an hour) on 
reporting an incipient disturbance. 

In its survey, the Community Relations Service described 
and analyzed experiences with codes in eleven major cities 
where they are currently in force. Members of the CRS staff 
conducted interviews with key citizens (newsmen, city officials, 
and community leaders) in each of the eleven cities, seeking 
comments on the effectiveness and practicality of the codes and 
guidelines used. CRS's major findings and conclusions are: 

• All codes and guidelines now in operation are basically volun- 
tary arrangements usually put forward by local authorities and 
accepted by the news media after consultation. Nowhere has 
an arrangement or agreement been effected that binds the news 
media without their assent. 

• No one interviewed in this survey considered the code or guide- 
lines in effect in his city as useless or harmful. CRS thought 
that, where they were in effect, the codes had a constructive 
impact on the local news media. Observers in some cities, how- 
ever, thought the increased sense of responsibility manifested 
by press and television was due more to experience with riot 
coverage than to the existence of the codes. 

• The more controversial and often least understood aspect of 
guidelines has been provision for a brief voluntary moratorium 
on the reporting of news. Some kind of moratorium is specified 
in the codes of six cities surveyed (Chicago, Omaha, Buffalo, 
Indianapolis, Kansas City, and Toledo), and the moratorium 
was invoked last summer in Chicago and Indianapolis. In each 
case, an effort to prevent quite minor racial incidents from 
escalating into more serious trouble was successful, and many 
thought the moratorium contributed. 

• The confusion about a moratorium, and the resulting aversion 
to it, is unfortunate. The specific period of delay is seldom 
more than 30 minutes. In practice, under today's conditions of 
reporting and broadcasting, this often will mean little if any 

381 


delay before the full story gets into the paper or on the air. 
The time can be used to prepare and edit the story and to verify 
and assess the reports of trouble. The only loss is the banner 
headline or the broadcast news bulletin that is released prema- 
turely to avoid being beaten by "the competition." It is just 
such reflexive responses that can lead to sensationalism and 
inaccuracy. In cities where a moratorium is part of the code, 
CRS interviewers detected no discontent over its presence. 
• The most frequent complaint about shortcomings in existing 
codes is that many of them do not reach the underpinnings of 
crisis situations. Ghetto spokesmen, in particular, said that the 
emphasis in the codes on conduct during the crisis itself tended 
to lead the media to neglect reporting the underlying causes 
of racial tension. 

At the Poughkeepsie Conference with media representa- 
tives, there was considerable criticism of the Chicago code on 
grounds that the moratorium is open ended. Once put into 
effect it is supposed to be maintained until "the situation is 
under control." There were doubts about how effective this 
code had been in practice. The voluntary news blackout in 
Detroit for part of the first day of the riot — apparently at the 
request of officials and civil rights groups — was cited as evi- 
dence that suppression of news of violence does not necessarily 
de-fuse a riot situation. 

On the basis of the CRS survey and other evidence, the 
Commission concludes that codes are seldom harmful, often 
useful, but no panacea. To be of any use, they must address 
themselves to the substance of the problems that plague rela- 
tions between the press and officialdom during a disorder, but 
they are only one of several methods of improving those rela- 
tions. Ultimately, no matter how sensitive and comprehensive 
a code or set of guidelines may be, efficient, accurate reporting 
must depend on the intelligence, judgment, and training of 
newsmen, police, and city officials together. 

HI. Reporting Racial Problems in the United States 

A Failure to Communicate 

The Commission's major concern with the news media is not 
in riot reporting as such, but in the failure to report adequate- 
ly on race relations and ghetto problems and to bring more 
Negroes into journalism. Concern about this was expressed by 
a number of participants in our Poughkeepsie conference. Dis- 
orders are only one aspect of the dilemmas and difficulties of 
race relations in America. In defining, explaining, and re- 
porting this broader, more complex and ultimately far more 

382 


fundamental subject, the communications media, ironically, 
have failed to communicate. 

They have not communicated to the majority of their audi- 
ence— which is white — a sense of the degradation, misery, and 
hopelessness of living in the ghetto. They have not communi- 
cated to whites a feeling for the difficulties and frustrations of 
being a Negro in the United States. They have not shown un- 
derstanding or appreciation of — and thus have not communi- 
cated— a sense of Negro culture, thought, or history. 

Equally important, most newspaper articles and most tele- 
vision programming ignore the fact that an appreciable part 
of their audience is black. The world that television and news- 
papers offer to their black audience is almost totally white, in 
both appearance and attitude. As we have said, our evidence 
shows that the so-called "white press" is at best mistrusted 
and at worst held in contempt by many black Americans. Far 
too often, the press acts and talks about Negroes as if Negroes 
do not read the newspapers or watch television, give birth, 
marry, die, and go to PTA meetings. Some newspapers and 
stations are beginning to make efforts to fill this void, but 
they have still a long way to go. 

The absence of Negro faces and activities from the media 
has an effect on white audiences as well as black. If what the 
white American reads in the newspapers or sees on television 
conditions his expectation of what is ordinary and normal in 
the larger society, he will neither understand nor accept the 
black American. By failing to portray the Negro as a matter 
of routine and in the context of the total society, the news 
media have, we believe, contributed to the black-white schism 
in this country. 

When the white press does refer to Negroes and Negro 
problems it frequently does so as if Negroes were not a part 
of the audience. This is perhaps understandable in a system 
where whites edit and, to a large extent, write news. But such 
attitudes, in an area as sensitive and inflammatory as this, feed 
Negro alienation and intensify white prejudices. 

We suggest that a top editor or news director monitor his 
news production for a period of several weeks, taking note 
of how certain stories and language will affect black readers or 
viewers. A Negro staff member could do this easily. Then the 
staff should be informed about the problems involved. 

The problems of race relations coverage go beyond incidents 
of white bias. Many editors and news directors, plagued by 
shortages of staff and lack of reliable contacts and sources of 
information in the city, have failed to recognize the signifi- 
cance of the urban story and to develop resources to cover it 
adequately. 

383 


We believe that most news organizations do not have direct 
access to diversified news sources in the ghetto. Seldom do they 
have a total sense of what is going on there. Some of the blame 
rests on Negro leaders who do not trust the media and will 
not deal candidly with representatives of the white press. But 
the real failure rests with the news organization themselves. 
They — like other elements of the white community — have ig- 
nored the ghettos for decades. Now they seek instant accept- 
ance and cooperation. 

The development of good contacts, reliable information, and 
understanding requires more effort and time than an occasional 
visit by a team of reporters to do a feature on a newly-dis- 
covered ghetto problem. It requires reporters permanently as- 
signed to this beat. They must be adequately trained and sup- 
ported to dig out and tell the story of a major social upheaval 
— among the most complicated, portentous and explosive our 
society has known. We believe, also, that the Negro Press — 
manned largely by people who live and work in the ghetto — 
could be a particularly useful source of information and guid- 
ance about activities in the black community. Reporters and 
editors from Negro newspapers and radio stations should be 
included in any conference between media and police-city 
representatives, and we suggest that large news organizations 
would do well to establish better lines of communication to 
their counterparts in the Negro press.10 

In short, the news media must find ways of exploring the 
problems of the Negro and the ghetto more deeply and more 
meaningfully. To editors who say "we have run thousands of 
inches on the ghetto which nobody reads" and to television 
executives who bemoan scores of underwatched documen- 
taries, we say: find more ways of telling this story, for it is a 
story you, as journalists, must tell — honestly, realistically, and 
imaginatively. It is the responsibility of the news media to tell 
the story of race relations in America, and with notable ex- 
ceptions, the media have not yet turned to the task with the 
wisdom, sensitivity, and expertise it demands. 

Negroes in Journalism 

The journalistic profession has been shockingly backward 
in seeking out, hiring, training, and promoting Negroes. Fewer 
than 5 percent of the people employed by the news business 
in editorial jobs in the United States today are Negroes. Fewer 
than 1 percent of editors and supervisors are Negroes, and 
most of them work for Negro-owned organizations. The lines 

10 We have not, in this report, examined the Negro press in detail. The 
thrust of our studies was directed at daily mass circulation, mass audience 
media which are aimed at the community as a whole. 

384 


of various news organizations to the militant blacks are, by 
admission of the newsmen themselves, almost nonexistent 
The plaint is, "We can't find qualified Negroes." But this rings 
hollow from an industry where, only yesterday, jobs were 
scarce and promotion unthinkable for a man whose skin was 
black. Even today, there are virtually no Negroes in positions 
of editorial or executive responsibility and there is only one 
Negro newsman with a nationally syndicated column. 

News organizations must employ enough Negroes in posi- 
tions of significant responsibility to establish an effective link 
to Negro actions and ideas and to meet legitimate employment 
expectations. Tokenism — the hiring of one Negro reporter, or 
even two or three — is no longer enough. Negro reporters are 
essential, but so are Negro editors, writers and commentators. 
Newspaper and television policies are, generally speaking, not 
set by reporters. Editorial decisions about which stories to 
cover and which to use are made by editors. Yet, very few 
Negroes in this country are involved in making these decisions, 
because very few, if any, supervisory editorial jobs are held by 
Negroes. We urge the news media to do everything possible to 
train and promote their Negro reporters to positions where 
those who are qualified can contribute to and have an effect 
on policy decisions. 

It is not enough, though, as many editors have pointed out 
to the Commission, to search for Negro journalists. Journalism 
is not very popular as a career for aspiring young Negroes. 
The starting pay is comparatively low and it is a business 
which has, until recently, discouraged and rejected them. The 
recruitment of Negro reporters must extend beyond established 
journalists, or those who have already formed ambitions along 
these lines. It must become a commitment to seek out young 
Negro men and women, inspire them to become — and then 
train them as — journalists. Training programs should be started 
at high schools and intensified at colleges. Summer vacation 
and part-time editorial jobs, coupled with offers of permanent 
employment, can awaken career plans. 

We believe that the news media themselves, their audiences 
and the country will profit from these undertakings. For if the 
media are to comprehend and then to project the Negro com- 
munity, they must have the help of Negroes. If the media are 
to report with understanding, wisdom and sympathy on the 
problems of the cities and the problems of the black man — 
for the two are increasingly intertwined — they must employ, 
promote and listen to Negro journalists. 

The Negro in the Media 

Finally, the news media must publish newspapers and pro- 

385 


duce programs that recognize the existence and activities or 
the Negro, both as a Negro and as part of the community. It 
would be a contribution of inestimable importance to race 
relations in the United States simply to treat ordinary news 
about Negroes as news of other groups is now treated. 

Specifically, newspapers should integrate Negroes and Negro 
activities into all parts of the paper, from the news, society and 
club pages to the comic strips. Television should develop pro- 
gramming which integrates Negroes into all aspects of televised 
presentations. Television is such a visible medium that some 
constructive steps are easy and obvious. While some of these 
steps are being taken, they are still largely neglected. For ex- 
ample, Negro reporters and performers should appear more 
frequently — and at prime time — in news broadcasts, on 
weather shows, in documentaries, and in advertisements. Some 
effort already has been made to use Negroes in television com- 
mercials. Any initial surprise at seeing a Negro selling a spon- 
sor's product will eventually fade into routine acceptance, an 
attitude that white society must ultimately develop toward all 
Negroes. 

In addition to news-related programming, we think that 
Negroes should appear more frequently in dramatic and 
comedy series. Moreover, networks and local stations should 
present plays and other programs whose subjects are rooted 
in the ghetto and its problems. 

IV. Institute of Urban Communications 

The Commission is aware that in this area, as in all other 
aspects of race relations, the problems are great and it is much 
easier to state them than to solve them. Various pressures — 
competitive, financial, advertising — may impede progress 
toward more balanced, in-depth coverage and toward the hir- 
ing and training of more Negro personnel. Most newspapers 
and local television and radio stations do not have the re- 
sources or the time to keep abreast of all the technical ad- 
vances, academic theories, and government programs affecting 
the cities and the lives of their black inhabitants. 

During the course of this study, the Commission members 
and the staff have had many conversations with publishers, 
editors, broadcasters, and reporters throughout the country. 
The consensus appears to be that most of them would like to 
do much more but simply do not have the resources for inde- 
pendent efforts at either training or coverage. 

The Commission believes that some of these problems could 
be resolved if there were a central organization to develop, 
gather and distribute talent, resources, and information and to 

386 


keep the work of the press in this field under review. For this 
reason, the Commission proposes the establishment of an Insti- 
tute of Urban Communications on a private, non-profit basis. 
The Institute would have neither governmental ties nor gov- 
ernmental authority. Its board would consist in substantial part 
of professional journalists and, for the rest, of distinguished 
public figures. The staff would be made up of journalists and 
students of the profession. Funding would be sought initially 
from private foundations. Ultimately, it may be hoped, fi- 
nancial support would be forthcoming from within the 
profession. 

The Institute would be charged, in the first instance, with 
general responsibility for carrying out the media recommen- 
dations of the Commission, though as it developed a momen- 
tum and life of its own it would also gain its own view of the 
problems and possibilities. Initial tasks would include: 

1. Training and education for journalists in the field of 
urban affairs. The Institute should organize and sponsor, on its 
own and in cooperation with universities and other institutions, 
a comprehensive range of courses, seminars and workshops 
designed to give reporters, editors and publishers the back- 
ground they need to cover the urban scene. Offerings would 
vary in duration and intensity from weekend conferences to 
grants for year-long individual study on the order of the 
Nieman Fellowships. 

All levels and all kinds of news outlets should be served. A 
most important activity might be to assist disc jockeys and 
commentators on stations that address themselves especially to 
the Negro community. Particularly important would be ses- 
sions of a month or more for seasoned reporters and editors, 
comparable to middle management seminars or mid-career 
training in other callings. The press must have all of the in- 
tellectual resources and background to give adequate coverage 
to the city and the ghetto. It should be the first duty of the 
Institute to see that this is provided. 

2. Recruitment, training and placement of Negro journalists. 
The scarcity of Negroes in responsible news jobs intensifies the 
difficulties of communicating the reality of the contemporary 
American city to white newspaper and television audiences. 
The special viewpoint of the Negro who has lived through 
these problems and bears their marks upon him is, as we have 
seen, notably absent from what is, on the whole, a white press. 
But full integration of Negroes into the journalistic profession 
is imperative in its own right. It is unacceptable that the press, 
itself the special beneficiary of fundamental constitutional pro- 
tections, should lag so far behind other fields in giving effect 
to the fundamental human right to equality of opportunity. 

387 


To help correct this situation, the Institute will have to un- 
dertake far-ranging activities. Providing educational opportu- 
nities for would-be Negro journalists is not enough. There will 
have to be changes in career outlooks for Negro students and 
their counselors back to the secondary school level. And 
changes in these attitudes will come slowly unless there is a 
change in the reality of employment and advancement oppor- 
tunities for Negroes in journalism. This requires an aggressive 
placement program, seeking out newspapers, television and 
radio stations that discriminate, whether consciously or un- 
consciously, and mobilizing the pressures, public, private and 
legal, necessary to break the pattern. The Institute might also 
provide assistance to Negro newspapers, which now recruit and 
train many young journalists. 

3. Police-press relations. The Commission has stressed the 
failures in this area, and has laid out a set of remedial measures 
for action at the local level. But if reliance is placed exclu- 
sively on local initiative we can predict that in many places — 
often those that need it most— our recommended steps will 
not be taken. Pressure from the federal government for action 
along the lines proposed would be suspect, probably, by both 
press and local officials. But the Institute could undertake the 
task of stimulating community action in line with the Com- 
mission's recommendations without arousing local hostility and 
suspicion. Moreover, the Institute could serve as a clearing 
house for exchange of experience in this field. 

4. Review of media performance on riots and racial issues. 
The Institute should review press and television coverage of 
riot and racial news and publicly award praise and blame. The 
Commission recognizes that government restraints or guide- 
lines in this field are both unworkable and incompatible with 
our Constitution and traditions. Internal guidelines or volun- 
tary advance arrangements may be useful, but they tend to be 
rather general and the standards they prescribe are neither 
self -applying nor self -enforcing. We believe it would be healthy 
for reporters and editors who work in this sensitive field to 
know that others will be viewing their work and will hold 
them publicly accountable for lapses from accepted standards 
of good journalism. The Institute should publicize its findings 
by means of regular and special reports. It might also set a 
series of awards for especially meritorious work of individuals 
or news organizations in race relations reporting. 

5. An urban affairs service. Whatever may be done to im- 
prove the quality of reporting on urban affairs, there always 
will be a great many outlets that are too small to support the 
specialized investigation, reporting and interpreting needed in 
this field. To fill this gap, the Institute could organize a com- 

388 


prehensive urban news service, available at a modest fee to any 
news organization that wanted it. The Institute would have its 
own specially trained reporters, and it would also cull the na- 
tional press for news and feature stories of broader interest 
that could be reprinted or broadcast by subscribers. 

6. Continuing research. Our own investigations have shown 
us that academic work on the impact of the media on race 
relations, its role in shaping attitudes, and the effects of the 
choices it makes on people's behavior, is in a rudimentary 
stage. The Commission's content analysis is the first study 
of its type of contemporary riot coverage, and it is extremely 
limited in scope. A whole range of questions needs intensive 
scholarly exploration, and indeed the development of new 
modes of research and analysis. The Institute should undertake 
many of these important projects under its own auspices and 
could stimulate others in the academic community to further 
research. 


Along with the country as a whole, the press has too long 
basked in a white world, looking out of it, if at all, with white 
men's eyes and a white perspective. That is no longer good 
enough. The painful process of readjustment that is required 
of the American news media must begin now. They must make 
a reality of integration — in both their product and personnel. 
They must insist on the highest standards of accuracy — not 
only reporting single events with care and skepticism, but plac- 
ing each event into meaningful perspective. They must report 
the travail of our cities with compassion and in depth. 

In all this, the Commission asks for fair and courageous 
journalism — commitment and coverage that are worthy of one 
of the crucial domestic stories in America's history. 


Chapter 16 / The Future o£ the Cities 

Introduction 

We believe action of the kind outlined in preceding pages 
can contribute substantially to control of disorders in the near 
future. But there should be no mistake about the long run. 
The underlying forces continue to gain momentum. 

The most basic of these is the accelerating segregation of 
low-income, disadvantaged Negroes within the ghettos of the 
largest American cities. 

389 


By 1985, the 12.1 million Negroes segregated within central 
cities today will have grown to approximately 20.3 million — 
an increase of 68 percent. 

Prospects for domestic peace and for the quality of Ameri- 
can life are linked directly to the future of these cities. 

Two critical questions must be confronted: Where do present 
trends now lead? What choices are open to us? 

I. The Key Trends 

Negro Population Growth1 

The size of the Negro population in central cities is closely 
related to total national Negro population growth. In the past 
16 years, about 98 percent of this growth has occurred within 
metropolitan areas, and 86 percent in the central cities of those 
areas. 

A conservative projection of national Negro population 
growth indicates continued rapid increases. For the period 
1966 to 1985, it will rise to a total of 30.7 million, gaining an 
average of 484,000 a year, or 7.6 percent more than the in- 
crease in each year from 1960 to 1966, 

CENTRAL  CITIES 

Further Negro population growth in central cities depends 
upon two key factors: in-migration from outside metropolitan 
areas, and patterns of Negro settlement within metropolitan 
areas. 

From 1960 to 1966, the Negro population of all central 
cities rose 2.4 million, 88.9 percent of total national Negro 
population growth. We estimate that natural growth accounted 
for 1.4 million, or 58 percent of this increase, and in-migration 
accounted for 1 million, or 42 percent. 

As of 1966, the Negro population in all central cities totaled 
12.1 million. By 1985, we have estimated that it will rise 68 
percent to 20.3 million. We believe that natural growth will 
account for 5.2 million of this increase and in-migration for 3.0 
million. 

Without significant Negro out-migration, then, the combined 
Negro populations of central cities will continue to grow by an 
average of 274,000 a year through 1985, even if no further 
in-migration occurs. 

Growth projected on the basis of natural increase and in- 

1 Tables and explanations of the projections on which they are based appear 
at the end of the chapter. 

390 


migration would raise the proportion of Negroes to whites in 
central cities by 1985 from the present 20.7 percent to be- 
tween an estimated 31 and 34.7 percent. 

LARGEST  CENTRAL  CITIES 

These, however, are national figures. Much faster increases 
will occur in the largest central cities where Negro growth has 
been concentrated in the past two decades. Washington, D. C, 
Gary, and Newark are already over half Negro. A continua- 
tion of recent trends would cause the following 10 major cities 
to become over 50 per cent Negro by the indicated dates: 


New Orleans 

1971 

St. Louis 

1978 

Richmond 

1971 

Detroit 

1979 

Baltimore 

1972 

Philadelphia 

1981 

Jacksonville 

1972 

Oakland 

1983 

Cleveland 

1975 

Chicago 

1984 

These cities, plus Washington, D. C, (now over 66 percent 
Negro) and Newark, contained 12.6 million people in 1960, or 
22 percent of the total population of all 224 American central 
cities. All 13 cities undoubtedly will have Negro majorities by 
1985, and the suburbs ringing them will remain largely all 
white, unless there are major changes in Negro fertility rates,2 
in-migration, settlement patterns or public policy. 

Experience indicates that Negro school enrollment in these 
and other cities will exceed 50 percent long before the total 
population reaches that mark. In fact, Negro students already 
comprise more than a majority in the public elementary schools 
of 12 of the 13 cities mentioned above. This occurs because 
the Negro population in central cities is much younger and 
because a much higher proportion of white children attend 
private schools. For example, St. Louis' population was about 
36 percent Negro in 1965; its public elementary school enroll- 
ment was 63 percent Negro. If present trends continue, many 
cities in addition to those listed above will have Negro school 
majorities by 1985, probably including: 

Dallas Louisville 

Pittsburgh Indianapolis 

Buffalo Kansas City, Mo. 

Cincinnati Hartford 

Harrisburg New Haven 

Thus, continued concentration of future Negro population

aged IS to 44. 

391 


growth in large central cities will produce significant changes 
in those cities over the next 20 years. Unless there are sharp 
changes in the factors influencing Negro settlement patterns 
within metropolitan areas, there is little doubt that the trend 
toward Negro majorities will continue. Even a complete cessa- 
tion of net Negro in-migration to central cities would merely 
postpone this result for a few years. 

Growth of the Young Negro Population 

We estimate that the nation's white population will grow 
16.6 million, or 9.6 percent, from 1966 to 1975, and the 
Negro population 3.8 million, or 17.7 percent, in the same 
period. The Negro age group from 15 to 24 years of age, how- 
ever, will grow much faster than either the Negro population 
as a whole, or the white population in the same age group. 

From 1966 to 1975, the number of Negroes in this age 
group will rise 1.6 million, or 40.1 percent. The white popula- 
tion aged 15 to 24 will rise 6.6 million, or 23.5 percent. 

This rapid increase in the young Negro population has 
important implications for the country. This group has the 
highest unemployment rate in the nation, commits a relatively 
high proportion of all crimes, and plays the most significant 
role in civil disorders. By the same token, it is a great reservoir 
of underused human resources which are vital to the nation. 

The Location of New Jobs 

Most new employment opportunities do not occur in central 
cities, near all-Negro neighborhoods. They are being created in 
suburbs and outlying areas — and this trend is likely to continue 
indefinitely. New office buildings have risen in the downtowns 
of large cities, often near all-Negro areas. But the out-flow of 
manufacturing and retailing facilities normally offsets this addi- 
tion significantly — and in many cases has caused a net loss of 
jobs in central cities while the new white collar jobs are often 
not available to ghetto residents. 

Providing employment for the swelling Negro ghetto popu- 
lation will require society to link these potential workers more 
closely with job locations. This can be done in three ways: by 
developing incentives to industry to create new employment 
centers near Negro residential areas; by opening suburban 
residential areas to Negroes and encouraging them to move 
closer to industrial centers; or by creating better transporta- 
tion between ghetto neighborhoods and new job locations. 

All three involve large public outlays. 

392 


The first method — creating new industries in or near the 
ghetto — is not likely to occur without government subsidies on 
a scale which convinces private firms that it will pay them to 
face the problems involved. 

The second method — opening up suburban areas to Negro 
occupancy — obviously requires effective fair housing laws. It 
will also require an extensive program of federally-aided, low- 
cost housing in many suburban areas. 

The third approach — improved transportation linking ghet- 
tos and suburbs — has received little attention from city plan- 
ners and municipal officials. A few demonstration projects show 
promise, but carrying them out on a large scale will be very 
costly. 

Although a high proportion of new jobs will be located in 
suburbs, there are still millions of jobs in central cities. Turn- 
over in those jobs alone can open up a great many potential 
positions for Negro central city residents — if employers cease 
racial discrimination in their hiring and promotion practices. 

Nevertheless, as the total number of Negro central city job- 
seekers continues to rise, the need to link them with emerging 
new employment in the suburbs will become increasingly 
urgent. 

The Increasing Cost of Municipal Services 

Local governments have had to bear a particularly heavy 
financial burden in the two decades since the end of World 
War II. All United States cities are highly dependent upon 
property taxes that are relatively unresponsive to changes in 
income. Consequently, growing municipalities have been hard- 
pressed for adequate revenues to meet rising demands for 
services generated by population increase. On the other hand, 
stable or declining cities have not only been faced with steady 
cost increases but also with a slow-growing, or even declining, 
tax base. 

As a result of the population shifts of the post-war period, 
concentrating the middle class in residential suburbs while 
leaving the poor in the central cities, the increasing burden of 
municipal taxes frequently falls upon that part of the urban 
population least able to pay them. 

Increasing concentrations of urban growth have called forth 
greater expenditures for every kind of public service: educa- 
tion, health, police protection, fire protection, parks, sanitation, 
etc. These expenditures have strikingly outpaced tax revenues. 

The story is summed up below : 

393

+58.7 

Local Government Revenues, Expenditures and Debt 

(Billions of dollars) 

1950 

Revenues 11.7 

Expenditures 17.0 

Debt outstanding 18.8 

Despite the growth of federal assistance to urban areas 
under various grant-in-aid programs, the fiscal plight of many 
cities is likely to grow even more serious in the future. Local 
expenditures inevitably will continue to rise steeply as a result 
of several factors, including the difficulty of increasing pro- 
ductivity in the predominantly service activities of local gov- 
ernments, and the rapid technologically-induced increases in 
productivity in other economic sectors. 

Traditionally, individual productivity has risen faster in the 
manufacturing, mining, construction, and agricultural sectors 
than in those involving personal services. 

However, all sectors compete with each other for talent and 
personnel. Wages and salaries in the service-dominated sectors 
generally must keep up, therefore, with those in the capital- 
dominated sectors. Since productivity in manufacturing has 
risen about 2.5 percent per year compounded over many dec- 
ades, and even faster in agriculture, the basis for setting costs 
in the service-dominated sectors has gone up, too. 

In the postwar period, costs of the same units of output have 
increased very rapidly in certain key activities of local govern- 
ment. For example, education is the single biggest form of 
expenditure by local governments (including school districts), 
accounting for about 40 percent of their outlays. From 1947 to 
1967, costs per pupil-day in United States public schools rose 
at a rate of 6.7 percent per year compounded — only slightly 
less than doubling every ten years.3 This major cost item is 
likely to keep on rising rapidly in the future, along with other 
government services like police, fire, and welfare activities. 

Some increases in productivity may occur in these fields, and 
some economies may be achieved through use of assistants 
such as police and teachers' aides. Nevertheless, the need to 
keep pace with private sector wage scales will force local gov- 
ernment costs to rise sharply. 

This and other future cost increases are important to future 
relations between central cities and suburbs. Rising costs will 
inevitably force central cities to demand more and more 
assistance from the federal government. But the federal govern- 
ment can obtain such funds through the income tax only 

8 It is true that the average pupil-teacher ratio declined from 28 to about 
25, and other improvements in teaching quality may have occurred. But they 
cannot account for anything approaching this rapid increase in costs. 

394 


from other parts of the economy. Suburban governments are, 
meanwhile, experiencing the same cost increases along with 
the rising resentment of their constituents. 

II. Choices for the Future 

The complexity of American society offers many choices for 
the future of relations between central cities and suburbs and 
patterns of white and Negro settlement in metropolitan areas. 
For practical purposes, however, we see two fundamental 
questions: 

• Should future Negro population growth be concentrated in cen- 
tral cities, as in the past 20 years, thereby forcing Negro and 
white populations to become even more residentially segregated? 

• Should society provide greatly increased special assistance to Ne- 
groes and other relatively disadvantaged population groups? 

For purposes of analysis, the Commission has defined three 
basic choices for the future embodying specific answers to these 
questions: 

The Present Policies Choice 

Under this course, the nation would maintain approximately 
the share of resources now being allocated to programs of 
assistance for the poor, unemployed and disadvantaged. These 
programs are likely to grow, given continuing economic growth 
and rising federal revenues, but they will not grow fast enough 
to stop, let alone reverse, the already deteriorating quality of 
life in central-city ghettos. 

This choice carries the highest ultimate price, as we will 
point out. 

The Enrichment Choice 

Under this course, the nation would seek to offset the effects 
of continued Negro segregation and deprivation in large city 
ghettos. The Enrichment Choice would aim at creating dra- 
matic improvements in the quality of life in disadvantaged 
central-city neighborhoods — both white and Negro. It would 
require marked increases in federal spending for education, 
housing, employment, job training, and social services. 

The Enrichment Choice would seek to lift poor Negroes 

395 


and whites above poverty status and thereby give them the 
capacity to enter the mainstream of American life. But it would 
not, at least for many years, appreciably affect either the in- 
creasing concentration of Negroes in the ghetto or racial 
segregation in residential areas outside the ghetto. 

The Integration Choice 

This choice would be aimed at reversing the movement of 
the country toward two societies, separate and unequal. 

The Integration Choice — like the Enrichment Choice — 
would call for large-scale improvement in the quality of ghetto 
life. But it would also involve both creating strong incentives 
for Negro movement out of central-city ghettos and enlarging 
freedom of choice concerning housing, employment, and 
schools. 

The result would fall considerably short of full integration. 
The experience of other ethnic groups indicates that some 
Negro households would be scattered in largely white residen- 
tial areas. Others — probably a larger number — would volun- 
tarily cluster together in largely Negro neighborhoods. The 
Integration Choice would thus produce both integration and 
segregation. But the segregation would be voluntary. 

Articulating these three choices plainly oversimplifies the 
possibilities open to the country. We believe, however, that they 
encompass the basic issues — issues which the American public 
must face if it is serious in its concern not only about civil 
disorder, but the future of our democratic society. 

III. The Present Policies Choice 

Powerful forces of social and political inertia are moving the 
country steadily along the course of existing policies toward a 
divided country. 

This course may well involve changes in many social and 
economic programs — but not enough to produce fundamental 
alterations in the key factors of Negro concentration, racial 
segregation, and the lack of sufficient enrichment to arrest the 
decay of deprived neighborhoods. 

Some movement towards enrichment can be found in efforts 
to encourage industries to locate plants in central cities, in 
increased federal expenditures for education, in the important 
concepts embodied in the "War on Poverty," and in the Model 
Cities Program. But congressional appropriations for even 
present federal programs have been so small that they fall 
short of effective enrichment. 

396 


As for challenging concentration and segregation, a national 
commitment to this purpose has yet to develop. 

Of the three future courses we have defined, the Present 
Policies Choice-^-the choice we are now making — is the course 
with the most ominous consequences for our society. 

The Probability of Future Civil Disorders 

We believe that the Present Policies Choice would lead to a 
larger number of violent incidents of the kind that have stimu- 
lated recent major disorders. 

First, it does nothing to raise the hopes, absorb the energies, 
or constructively challenge the talents of the rapidly-growing 
number of young Negro men in central, cities. The proportion 
of unemployed or underemployed among them will remain 
very high. These young men have contributed disproportion- 
ately to crime and violence in cities in the past, and there is 
danger, obviously, that they will continue to do so. 

Second, under these conditions, a rising proportion of 
Negroes in disadvantaged city areas might come to look upon 
the deprivation and segregation they suffer as proper justifica- 
tion for violent protest or for extending support to now isolated 
extremists who advocate civil disruption by guerrilla tactics. 

More incidents would not necessarily mean more or worse 
riots. For the near future, there is substantial likelihood that 
even an increased number of incidents could be controlled be- 
fore becoming major disorders, if society undertakes to im- 
prove police and National Guard forces so that they can 
respond to potential disorders with more prompt and disci- 
plined use of force. 

In fact, the likelihood of incidents mushrooming into major 
disorders would be only slightly higher in the near future under 
the Present Policies Choice than under the other two possible 
choices. For no new policies or programs could possibly alter 
basic ghetto conditions immediately. And the announcement of 
new programs under the other choices would immediately 
generate new expectations. Expectations inevitably increase 
faster than performance: in the short run, they might even 
increase the level of frustration. 

In the long run, however, the Present Policies Choice risks 
a seriously greater probability of major disorders, worse, pos- 
sibly, than those already experienced. 

If the Negro population as a whole developed even stronger 
feelings of being wrongly "penned in" and discriminated 
against, many of its members might come to support not only 
riots, but the rebellion now being preached by only a handful. 

397 


If large-scale violence resulted, white retaliation could 
follow. This spiral could quite conceivably lead to a kind of 
urban apartheid with semi-martial law in many major cities, 
enforced residence of Negroes in segregated areas, and a 
drastic reduction in personal freedom for all Americans, 
particularly Negroes. 

The same distinction is applicable to the cost of the Present 
Policies Choice. In the short run, its costs — at least its direct 
cash outlays — would be far less than for the other choices. 

Any social and economic programs likely to have significant 
lasting effect would require very substantial annual appropria- 
tions for many years. Their cost would far exceed the direct 
losses sustained in recent civil disorders. Property damage in all 
the disorders we investigated, including Detroit and Newark, 
totalled less than $100 million. 

But it would be a tragic mistake to view the Present Policies 
Choice as cheap. Damage figures measure only a small part of 
the costs of civil disorder. They cannot measure the costs in 
terms of the lives lost, injuries suffered, minds and attitudes 
closed and frozen in prejudice, or the hidden costs of the 
profound disruption of entire cities. 

Ultimately, moreover, the economic and social costs of the 
Present Policies Choice will far surpass the cost of the alterna- 
tives. The rising concentration of impoverished Negroes and 
other minorities within the urban ghettos will constantly ex- 
pand public expenditures for welfare, law enforcement, un- 
employment and other existing programs without arresting the 
decay of older city neighborhoods and the breeding of frustra- 
tion and discontent. But the most significant item on the bal- 
ance of accounts will remain largely invisible and incalculable 
— the toll in human values taken by continued poverty, segre- 
gation and inequality of opportunity. 

Polarization 

Another and equally serious consequence is the fact that this 
course would lead to the permanent establishment of two soci- 
eties: one predominantly white and located in the suburbs, in 
smaller cities, and in outlying areas, and one largely Negro 
located in central cities. 

We are well on the way to just such a divided nation. 

This division is veiled by the fact that Negroes do not now 
dominate many central cities. But they soon will, as we have 
shown, and the new Negro mayors will be facing even more 
difficult conditions than now exist. 

As Negroes succeed whites in our largest cities, the propor- 
tion of low-income residents in those cities will probably in- 

398 


crease. This is likely even if both white and Negro incomes 
continue to rise at recent rates, since Negroes have much lower 
incomes than whites. Moreover, many of the ills of large central 
cities spring from their age, their location, and their obsolete 
physical structures. The deterioration and economic decay 
stemming from these factors have been proceeding for decades 
and will continue to plague older cities regardless of who 
resides in them. 

These facts underlie the fourfold dilemma of the American 
city: 

• Fewer tax dollars come in, as large numbers of middle-income 
taxpayers move out of central cities and property values and 
business decline; 

• More tax dollars are required, to provide essential public services 
and facilities, and to meet the needs of expanding lower-income 
groups; 

• Each tax dollar buys less, because of increasing costs; 

• Citizen dissatisfaction with municipal services grows as needs, 
expectations and standards of living increase throughout the 
community. 

These are the conditions that would greet the Negro- 
dominated municipal governments that will gradually come to 
power in many of our major cities. The Negro electorates in 
those cities probably would demand basic changes in present 
policies. Like the present white electorates there, they would 
have to look for assistance to two basic sources: the private 
sector and the federal government. 

With respect to the private sector, major private capital 
investment in those cities might have ceased almost altogether 
if white-dominated firms and industries decided the risks and 
costs were too great. The withdrawal of private capital is 
already far advanced in most all-Negro areas of our large 
cities. 

Even if private investment continued, it alone would not 
suffice. Big cities containing high proportions of low-income 
Negroes and block after block of deteriorating older property 
need very substantial assistance from the federal government 
to meet the demands of their electorates for improved services 
and living conditions. 

By that time, however, it is probable that Congress will be 
more heavily influenced by representatives of the suburban and 
outlying city electorate. These areas will comprise 40 percent 
of our total population by 1985, compared with 31 percent in 
1960, Central cities will decline from 32 percent to 27 per- 
cent.4 

4 Based on Census Bureau Series D projections.

Yet even the suburbs will be feeling the squeeze of higher 
local government costs. Hence, Congress might resist providing 
the extensive assistance which central cities will desperately 
need. 

Thus the Present Policies Choice, if pursued for any length 
of time, might force simultaneous political and economic 
polarization in many of our largest metropolitan areas. Such 
polarization would involve large central cities — mainly Negro, 
with many poor, and nearly bankrupt — on the one hand, and 
most suburbs — mainly white, generally affluent, but heavily 
taxed — on the other hand. 

Some areas might avoid political confrontation by shifting 
to some form of metropolitan government designed to offer 
regional solutions for pressing urban problems such as property 
taxation, air and water pollution and refuse disposal, and 
commuter transport. Yet this would hardly eliminate the basic 
segregation and relative poverty of the urban Negro popula- 
tion. It might even increase the Negro's sense of frustration and 
alienation if it operated to prevent Negro political control of 
central cities. 

The acquisition of power by Negro-dominated governments 
in central cities is surely a legitimate and desirable exercise of 
political power by a minority group. It is in an American politi- 
cal tradition exemplified by the achievements of the Irish in 
New York and Boston. 

But such Negro political development would also involve 
virtually complete racial segregation and virtually complete 
spatial separation. By 1985, the separate Negro society in our 
central cities would contain almost 21 million citizens. That is 
almost 68 percent larger than the present Negro population of 
central cities. It is also larger than the current population of 
every Negro nation in Africa except Nigeria. 

If developing a racially integrated society is extraordinarily 
difficult today when 12.1 million Negroes live in central cities, 
then it is quite clearly going to be virtually impossible in 1985 
when almost 21 million Negroes — still much poorer and less 
educated than most whites — will be living there. 

Can Present Policies Avert Extreme Polarization? 

There are at least two possible developments under the 
Present Policies Choice which might avert such polarization. 
The first is a faster increase of incomes among Negroes than 
has occurred in the recent past. This might prevent central 
cities from becoming even deeper "poverty traps" than they 

400 


now are. It suggests the importance of effective job programs 
and higher levels of welfare payments for dependent families. 

The second possible development is migration of a growing 
Negro middle class out of the central city. This would not 
prevent competition for federal funds between central cities 
and outlying areas, but it might diminish the racial undertones 
of that competition. 

There is, however, no evidence that a continuation of pres- 
ent policies would be accompanied by any such movement. 
There is already a significant Negro middle class. It grew 
rapidly from 1960 to 1966. Yet in these years, 88.9 percent of 
the total national growth of Negro population was concen- 
trated in central cities — the highest in history. Indeed, from 
1960 to 1966, there was actually a net total in-migration of 
Negroes from the urban fringes of metropolitan areas into 
central cities.5 The Commission believes it unlikely that this 
trend will suddenly reverse itself without significant changes in 
private attitudes and public policies. 

IV. The Enrichment Choice 

The Present Policies Choice plainly would involve continua- 
tion of efforts like Model Cities, manpower programs, and the 
War on Poverty. These are in fact enrichment programs, de- 
signed to improve the quality of life in the ghetto. 

Because of their limited scope and funds, however, they 
constitute only very modest steps toward enrichment — and 
would continue to do so even if these programs were somewhat 
enlarged or supplemented. 

The premise of the Enrichment Choice is performance. To 
adopt this choice would require a substantially greater share 
of national resources — sufficient to make a dramatic, visible 
impact on life in the urban Negro ghetto. 

The Effect of Enrichment on Civil Disorders 

Effective enrichment policies probably would have three 
immediate effects on civil disorders. 

First, announcement of specific large-scale programs and 
the demonstration of a strong intent to carry them out might 
persuade ghetto residents that genuine remedies for their prob- 
lems were forthcoming, thereby allaying tensions. 

Second, such announcements would strongly stimulate the 
aspirations and hopes of members of these communities — 

5 Although Negro population on the urban fringe of metropolitan areas did 
increase slightly (0.2 million) from 1960 to 1966, it is safe to assume an 
actual net in-migration to central cities from these areas based upon the rate 
of natural increase of the Negro population. 

401 


possibly well beyond the capabilities of society to deliver and to 
do so promptly. This might increase frustration and discontent, 
to some extent cancelling the first effect. 

Third, if there could be immediate action on meaningful job 
training and the creation of productive jobs for large numbers 
of unemployed young people, they would become much less 
likely to engage in civil disorders. 

Such action is difficult now, when there are about 585,000 
young Negro men aged 14 to 24 in the civilian labor force in 
central cities — of whom 81,000 or 13.8 percent, are unem- 
ployed and probably two or three times as many are under- 
employed. It will not become easier in the future. By 1975, 
this age group will have grown to nearly 700,000. 

Given the size of the present problem, plus the large growth 
of this age group, creation of sufficient meaningful jobs will 
require extensive programs, begun rapidly. Even if the nation 
is willing to embark on such programs, there is no certainty 
that they can be made effective soon enough. 

Consequently, there is no certainty that the Enrichment 
Choice would do much more in the near future to diminish 
violent incidents in central cities than would the Present Poli- 
cies Choice. However, if enrichment programs can succeed in 
meeting the needs of residents of disadvantaged areas for jobs, 
education, housing and city services, then over the years this 
choice is almost certain to reduce both the level and frequency 
of urban disorder. 

The Negro Middle Class 

One objective of the Enrichment Choice would be to help 
as many disadvantaged Americans as possible — of all races — 
to enter the mainstream of American prosperity, to progress 
toward what is often called middle-class status. If the Enrich- 
ment Choice were adopted, it could certainly attain this objec- 
tive to a far greater degree than would the Present Policies 
Choice. This could significantly change the quality of life in 
many central city areas. 

It can be argued that a rapidly enlarging Negro middle class 
would also promote Negro out-migration, and thus the En- 
richment Choice would open up an escape hatch from the 
ghetto. This argument, however, has two weaknesses. 

The first is experience. Central cities already have sizable 
and growing numbers of middle-class Negro families. Yet only 
a few have migrated from the central city. The past pattern 
of white ethnic groups gradually moving out of central-city 
areas to middle-class suburbs has not applied to Negroes. 
Effective open-housing laws will help make this possible. It is 

402 


probable, however, that other more extensive changes in pol- 
icies and attitudes will be required — and these would extend 
beyond the Enrichment Choice. 

The second weakness in the argument is time. Even if en- 
largement of the Negro middle class succeeded in encouraging 
movement out of the central city, it could not do so fast enough 
to offset the rapid growth of the ghetto. To offset even half 
the growth estimated for the ghetto by 1975 would call for 
the out-migration from central cities of 217,000 persons a 
year. This is eight times the annual increase in suburban Ne- 
gro population — including natural increase — which occurred 
from 1960 to 1966. Even the most effective enrichment pro- 
gram is not likely to accomplish this. 

A corollary problem derives from the continuing migration 
of poor Negroes from the Southern to Northern and Western 
cities. 

Adoption of the Enrichment Choice would require large- 
scale efforts to improve conditions in the South sufficiently to 
remove the pressure to migrate. Under present conditions, 
slightly over a third of the estimated increase in Negro central- 
city population by 1985 will result from in-migration — 3.0 
million out of total increase of 8.2 million. 

Negro Self-Development 

The Enrichment Choice is in line with some of the currents 
of Negro protest thought that fall under the label of "Black 
Power." We do not refer to versions of Black Power ideology 
which promote violence, generate racial hatred, or advocate 
total separation of the races. Rather, we mean the view which 
asserts that the American Negro population can assume its 
proper role in society and overcome its feelings of powerless- 
ness and lack of self-respect only by exerting power over 
decisions which directly affect its own members. A fully inte- 
grated society is not thought possible until the Negro minority 
within the ghetto has developed political strength — a strong 
bargaining position in dealing with the rest of society. 

In short, this argument would regard predominantly Negro 
central cities and predominantly white outlying areas not as 
harmful, but as an advantageous future. 

Proponents of these views also focus on the need for the 
Negro to organize economically as well as politically, thus 
tapping new energies and resources for self-development. One 
of the hardest tasks in improving disadvantaged areas is to 
discover how deeply deprived residents can develop their own 
capabilities by participating more fully in decisions and activi- 
ties which affect them. Such learning-by-doing efforts are a 

403 


vital part of the process of bringing deprived people into the 
social mainstream. 

Separate But Equal Societies? 

The Enrichment Choice by no means seeks to perpetuate 
racial segregation. In the end, however, its premise is that 
disadvantaged Negroes can achieve equality of opportunity 
with whites while continuing in conditions of nearly complete 
separation. 

This premise has been vigorously advocated by Black Power 
proponents. While most Negroes originally desired racial in- 
tegration, many are losing hope of ever achieving it because 
of seemingly implacable white resistance. Yet they cannot 
bring themselves to accept the conclusion that most of the 
millions of Negroes who are forced to live racially segregated 
lives must therefore be condemned to inferior lives — to in- 
ferior educations, or inferior housing, or inferior status. 

Rather, they reason, there must be some way to make the 
quality of life in the ghetto areas just as good — or better — 
than elsewhere. It is not surprising that some Black Power 
advocates are denouncing integration and claiming that, given 
the hypocrisy and racism that pervade white society, life in a 
black society is, in fact, morally superior. This argument is 
understandable, but there is a great deal of evidence that it is 
unrealistic. 

The economy of the United States and particularly the 
sources of employment are preponderantly white. In this cir- 
cumstance, a policy of separate but equal employment could 
only relegate Negroes permanently to inferior incomes and 
economic status. 

The best evidence regarding education is contained in recent 
reports of the Office of Education and Civil Rights Commis- 
sion which suggest that both racial and economic integration 
are essential to educational equality for Negroes. Yet critics 
point out that, certainly until integration is achieved, various 
types of enrichment programs must be tested, and that dra- 
matically different results may be possible from intensive edu- 
cational enrichment — such as far smaller classes, or greatly 
expanded pre-school programs, or changes in the home en- 
vironment of Negro children resulting from steady jobs for 
fathers. 

Still others advocate shifting control over ghetto schools 
from professional administrators to local residents. This, they 
say, would improve curricula, give students a greater sense of 

404 


their own value, and thus raise their morale and educational 
achievement. These approaches have not yet been tested suf- 
ficiently. One conclusion, however, does seem reasonable: 
any real improvement in the quality of education in low- 
income, all-Negro areas will cost a great deal more money 
than is now being spent there — and perhaps more than is 
being spent per pupil anywhere. Racial and social class inte- 
gration of schools may produce equal improvement in achieve- 
ment at less total cost. 

Whether or not enrichment in ghetto areas will really work 
is not yet known, but the Enrichment Choice is based on the 
yet-unproved premise that it will. Certainly, enrichment pro- 
grams could significantly improve existing ghetto schools if 
they impelled major innovations. But "separate but equal" 
ghetto education cannot meet the long-run fundamental edu- 
cational needs of the central-city Negro population. 

The three basic educational choices are: providing Negro 
children with quality education in integrated schools; provid- 
ing them with quality education by enriching ghetto schools; 
or continuing to provide many Negro children with inferior 
education in racially segregated school systems, severely limit- 
ing their life-time opportunities. 

Consciously or not, it is the third choice that the nation 
is now making, and this choice the Commission rejects totally. 

In the field of housing, it is obvious that "separate but 
equal" does not mean really equal. The Enrichment Choice 
could greatly improve the quantity, variety, and environment 
of decent housing available to the ghetto population. It could 
not provide Negroes with the same freedom and range of 
choice as whites with equal incomes. Smaller cities and sub- 
urban areas together with the central city provide a far 
greater variety of housing and environmental settings than the 
central city alone. Programs to provide housing outside cen- 
tral cities, however, extend beyond the bounds of the En- 
richment Choice. 

In the end, whatever its benefits, the Enrichment Choice 
mightjwell invite a prospect similar to that of the Present 
Policies Choice: separate white and black societies. 

If enrichment programs were effective, they could greatly 
narrow the gap in income, education, housing, jobs, and other 
qualities of life between the ghetto and the mainstream. Hence 
the chances of harsh polarization — or of disorder — in the next 
20 years would be greatly reduced. 

Whether they would be reduced far enough depends on the 
scope of the programs. Even if the gap were narrowed from 

405 


the present, it still could remain as a strong source of tension. 
History teaches that men are not necessarily placated even 
by great absolute progress. The controlling factor is relative 
progress — whether they still perceive a significant gap between 
themselves and others whom they regard as no more deserv- 
ing. Widespread perception of such a gap — -and consequent 
resentment — might well be precisely the situation 20 years 
from now under the Enrichment Choice, for it is essentially 
another way of choosing a permanently divided country. 

V. The Integration Choice 

The third and last course open to the nation combines en- 
richment with programs designed to encourage integration 
of substantial numbers of Negroes into the society outside 
the ghetto. j 

Enrichment must be an important adjunct to any integration 
course. No matter how ambitious or energetic such a program 
may be, relatively few Negroes now living in central-city 
ghettos would be quickly integrated. In the meantime, signifi- 
cant improvement in their present environment is essential. 

The enrichment aspect of this third choice should, however, 
be recognized as interim action, during which time expanded 
and new programs can work to improve education and earn- 
ing power. The length of the interim period surely would vary. 
For some it may be long. But in any event, what should be 
clearly recognized is that enrichment is only a means toward 
the goal; it is not the goal. 

The goal must be achieving freedom for every citizen to live 
and work according to his capacities and desires, not his color. 

We believe there are four important reasons why American 
society must give this course the most serious consideration. 
First, future jobs are being created primarily in the suburbs, 
while the chronically unemployed population is increasingly 
concentrated in the ghetto. This separation will make it more 
and more difficult for Negroes to achieve anything like full em- 
ployment in decent jobs. But if, over time, these residents 
began to find housing outside central cities, they would be 
exposed to more knowledge of job opportunities. They would 
have to make much shorter trips to reach jobs. They would 
have a far better chance of securing employment on a self- 
sustaining basis. 

Second, in the judgment of this Commission, racial and 
social-class integration is the most effective way of improving 
the education of ghetto children. 

Third, developing an adequate housing supply for low- 

40d 


income and middle-income families and true freedom of choice 
in housing for Negroes of all income levels will require sub- 
stantial out-movement. We do not believe that such an out- 
movement will occur spontaneously merely as a result of in- 
creasing prosperity among Negroes in central cities. A na- 
tional fair housing law is essential to begin such movement. 
In many suburban areas, a program combining positive in- 
centives with the building of new housing will be necessary to 
carry it out. 

Fourth, and by far the most important, integration is the 
only course which explicitly seeks to achieve a single nation 
rather than accepting the present movement toward a dual 
society. This choice would enable us at least to begin reversing 
the profoundly divisive trend already so evident in our metro- 
politan areas — before it becomes irreversible. 

VI.   Conclusions 

The future of our cities is neither something which will just 
happen nor something which will be imposed upon us by an 
inevitable destiny. That future will be shaped to an important 
degree by choices we make now. 

We have attempted to set forth the major choices because 
we believe it is vital for Americans to understand the conse- 
quences of our present drift. 

Three critical conclusions emerge from this analysis: 

1. The nation is rapidly moving toward two increasingly 
separate Americas. 

Within two decades, this division could be so deep that it 
would be almost impossible to unite: 

• a white society principally located in suburbs, in smaller central 
cities, and in the peripheral parts of large central cities; and 

• a Negro society largely concentrated within large central cities. 

The Negro society will be permanently relegated to its cur- 
rent status, possibly even if we expend great amounts of money 
and effort in trying to "gild" the ghetto. 

2. In the long run, continuation and expansion of such a 
permanent division threatens us with two perils. 

The first is the danger of sustained violence in our cities. 
The timing, scale, nature, and repercussions of such violence 
cannot be foreseen. But if it occurred, it would further destroy 
our ability to achieve the basic American promises of liberty, 
justice, and equality. 

The second is the danger of a conclusive repudiation of the 

407 


traditional American ideals of individual dignity, freedom, and 
equality of opportunity. We will not be able to espouse these 
ideals meaningfully to the rest of the world, to ourselves, to 
our children. They may still recite the Pledge of Allegiance and 
say "one nation . . . indivisible." But they will be learning 
cynicism, not patriotism. 

3. We cannot escape responsibility for choosing the future 
of our metropolitan areas and the human relations which de- 
velop within them. It is a responsibility so critical that even an 
unconscious choice to continue present policies has the gravest 
implications. 

That we have delayed in choosing or, by delaying, may be 
making the wrong choice, does not sentence us either to separa- 
tism or despair. But we must choose. We will choose. Indeed, 
we are now choosing. 

Note on Negro Population Projections 

1. The Census Bureau publishes four projections of future population growth 
based upon differing assumptions about future fertility rates (i.e., the 
rate is the annual number of live births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44). 
Series A assumes fertility rates similar to those prevalent from 1962 to 1966. 
Series B through D assume lower rates. Assuming that Negro fertility rates 
will continue to decline, we have used the average of Series C and D — which 
are based on the lowest assumptions about such rates. We have also con- 
verted the Census Bureau's non white population projections into Negro 
projections by assuming Negroes will continue to comprise about 92 percent 
of all nonwhites. If, however, fertility rates remain at their present levels, 
then the total Negro population in 1985 would be 35.8 million rather than 
30.7 million. The average annual rate of increase from 1966 to 1985 would 
be 753,000, rather than 484,000 — 56 percent higher. 
The projection is as follows:

, The general concept of a metropolitan area is of an integrated, economic 
and social unit with a recognized large population nucleus. Statistically, it is 
called a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area — one which contains at 
least one central city of at least 50,000 inhabitants. It covers the county of 
the central city and adjacent counties found to be economically and socially 
integrated with that county. 

A Central City is the largest city of an SMSA and which gives the SMSA 
its name. 

"Core city" or "inner city" is a popular expression sometimes meaning 
central city and sometimes meaning the central business district and densely 
populated downtown neighborhoods of generally poorer residents. 
The array of statistical materials for metropolitan areas by "central city" 
and "outside central city" categories carries with it some dangers. The 
general proposition made in such displays is that the Negro population 

408 


is concentrated in the central city and is kept out of the suburbs. Certainly 
this is true. 

The danger arises from the inference which the reader may make about the 
character of "outside central city" and "suburb." "Outside central city" 
means the whole metropolitan area outside the city or cities whose names 
are given to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. This is not a 
homogeneous, affluent, white-only collection of bedroom communities or 
housing developments. It is a wide-ranging assortment of these and more. 
Some are attractive communities with trees, grass and fresh air. Others are 
grimy, industrial towns with all the problems commonly associated with 
the central city. There are, in fact, 246 cities of over 25.000 "hidden" 
in the concept "outside central city." Seventy-seven of these had over 
50,000 population in 1960. Many are white only or close to it. Many are 
not. Some even have higher proportions of Negroes to total population 
than the central cities of the metropolitan areas of which they are a part. 
Some of these cities are new. Some are old and have to fight the same 
battles against urban blight as the central cities of many metropolitan areas, 

3. We have considered two projections of this population. The first projection 
assumes no further in-migration or out-migration of Negroes to or from 
central cities. This assumption is unrealistic, but it provides a measure of 
how much the central-city Negro population is likely to expand through 
natural increase alone. The second: projection assumes that central cities 
will continue to contain 88.9 percent of all Negro population growth, as 
they did from 1960 to 1966.

1980 15.6 17.7 

1985 17.3 20.3 

Thus, even assuming no Negro migration into central cities, the total 
Negro population would increase six million, 43.0 percent, by 1985. Under 
the more realistic assumption of both continued in-migration (at present 
rates) and natural growth, total Negro population of central cities would 
increase by 8.2 million Negroes, 68 percent. 

4. We have arrived at these estimates by making three different assumptions 
about future white central-city population shifts: (a) that it will remain 
constant at its 1966 level of 46.4 million; (b) that it will decline, as it did 
from 1960 to 1966, by an amount equal to half the increase in central-city 
Negro population; and (c) that it will decline by an absolute amount equal 
to the total gains in central-city Negro population. In all three cases, we 
assume that Negro central-city population will continue to account for 88.9 
percent of all Negro population growth. The full projections are as follows:

The first assumption requires a rise in total central-city population from 
58.5 million in 1966 to 66.7 million in 1985. Since many of the largest central 
cities are already almost fully developed, so large an increase is probably 
unrealistic. On the other hand, the third assumption involves no change 
in the 1966 central-city population figure of 58.5 million. This may be 
unrealistically low. But in any event, it seems likely that continued concen- 
tration will cause the total proportion of Negroes in central cities to reach 
at least 25 percent by 1975 and 30 percent by 1985.

Chapter 17 / Recommendations for 
National Action 

Introduction 

The Commission has already addressed itself to the need for 
immediate action at the local level. Because the city is the focus 
of racial disorder, the immediate responsibility rests on com- 
munity leaders and local institutions. Without responsive and 
representative local government, without effective processes of 
interracial communication within the city, and without alert, 
well-trained and adequately supported local police, national 
action — no matter how great its scale — cannot be expected to 
provide a solution. 

Yet the disorders are not simply a problem of the racial ghet- 
to or the city. As we have seen, they are symptoms of social 
ills that have become endemic in our society and now affect 
every American — black or white, businessman or factory work- 
er, suburban commuter or slum dweller. 

None of us can escape the consequences of the continuing 
economic and social decay of the central city and the closely 
related problem of rural poverty. The convergence of these 
conditions in the racial ghetto and the resulting discontent and 
disruption threaten democratic values fundamental to our 
progress as a free society. 

The essential fact is that neither existing conditions nor the 
garrison state offer acceptable alternatives for the future of this 
country. Only a greatly enlarged commitment to national action 
— compassionate, massive and sustained, backed by the will 
and resources of the most powerful and the richest nation on 
this earth — can shape a future that is compatible with the his- 
toric ideals of American society. 

It is this conviction that leads us, as a commission on civil 
disorders, to comment on the shape and dimensions of the 
action that must be taken at the national level. 

In this effort we have taken account of the work of scholars 
and experts on race relations, the urban condition and poverty. 
We have studied the reports and work of other commissions, 
of congressional committees and of many special task forces 
and groups both within the government and within the private 
sector. 

Financing the Cost 

The Commission has also examined the question of financ- 
ing; although there are grave difficulties, we do not regard

them as insoluble. The nation has substantial financial resources 
— not enough to do everything some might wish, but enough 
to make an important start on reducing our critical "social 
deficit," in spite of a war and in spite of current budget require- 
ments. 

The key factors having a bearing on our ability to pay for 
the cost are the great productivity of the American economy, 
and a Federal revenue system which is highly responsive to 
economic growth. In combination, these produce truly astound- 
ing automatic increases in Federal budget receipts, provided 
only that "the national economy is kept functioning at capacity, 
so that actual national income expands in line with potential. 

These automatic increases — the "fiscal dividend" — from the 
Federal revenue system range from $11 billion to $14 bil- 
lion under conditions of steady economic growth. 

The tax surcharge requested by the President, including 
continuation of excise taxes, would add about $16 billion to 
a fiscal dividend of about $28.5 billion over a two-year period. 

While competing demands are certain to grow with every 
increase in federal revenues, so that hard choices are inevitable, 
these figures demonstrate the dimension of resources — apart 
from changes in tax rates — which this country can generate. 

Federal Program Coordination 

The spectacle of Detroit and New Haven engulfed in civil 
turmoil despite a multitude of federally-aided programs raised 
basic questions as to whether existing "delivery system" is 
adequate to the bold new purposes of national policy. Many 
who voiced these concerns overlooked the disparity between 
the size of the problems at which the programs are aimed and 
the level of funding provided by the federal government. 

Yet there is little doubt that the system through which fed- 
eral programs are translated into services to people is a major 
problem in itself. There are now over 400 grant programs 
operated by a broad range of federal agencies and channeled 
through a much larger array of semi-autonomous state and 
local government entities. Reflective of this complex scheme, 
federal programs often seem self-defeating and contradictory: 
field officials unable to make decisions on their own programs 
and unaware of related efforts; agencies unable or unwilling 
to work together; programs conceived and administered to 
achieve different and sometimes conflicting purposes. 

The new social development legislation has put great strain 
upon obsolescent machinery and administrative practices at all 
levels of government. It has loaded new work on federal de- 

411 


partments. It has required a level of skill, a sense of urgency, 
and a capacity for judgment never planned for or encouraged 
in departmental field offices. It has required planning and ad- 
ministrative capacity rarely seen in statehouses, county court- 
houses and city halls. 

Deficiencies in all of these areas have frustrated accom- 
plishment of many of the important goals set by the President 
and the Congress. 

In recent years serious efforts have been made to improve 
program coordination. During the 1961-1965 period, almost 
20 executive orders were issued for the coordination of federal 
programs involving intergovernmental administration. Some 
two dozen interagency committees have been established to 
coordinate two or more federal aid programs. Departments 
have been given responsibility to lead others in areas within 
their particular competence — OEO, in the poverty field, HUD 
in Model Cities. Yet, despite these and other efforts, the Fed- 
eral Government has not yet been able to join talent, funds 
and programs for concentrated impact in the field. Few agen- 
cies are able to put together a comprehensive package of 
related programs to meet priority needs. 

There is a clear and compelling requirement for better co- 
ordination of federally funded programs, particularly those 
designed to benefit the residents of the inner city. If essential 
programs are to be preserved and expanded, this need must 
be met. 

The Commission's Recommendations 

We do not claim competence to chart the details of pro- 
grams within such complex and interrelated fields as employ- 
ment, welfare, education and housing. We do believe it is 
essential to set forth goals and to recommend strategies to 
reach these goals. 

That is the aim of the pages that follow. They contain our 
sense of the critical priorities. We discuss and recommend 
programs not to commit each of us to specific parts of such 
programs but to illustrate the type and dimension of action 
needed. 

Much has been accomplished in recent years to formulate 
new directions for national policy and new channels for na- 
tional energy. Resources devoted to social programs have 
been greatly increased in many areas. Hence, few of our pro- 
gram suggestions are entirely novel. In some form, many are 
already in effect. 

All this serves to underscore our basic conclusion: the need 
is not so much for the government to design new programs 

412 


as it is for the nation to generate new will. Private enterprise, 
labor unions, the churches, the foundations, the universities — 
all our urban institutions — must deepen their involvement in 
the life of the city and their commitment to its revival and 
welfare. 

Objectives for National Action 

Just as Lincoln, a century ago, put preservation of the 
Union above all else, so should we put creation of a true union 
— a single society and a single American identity — as our 
major goal. Toward that goal, we propose the following ob- 
jectives for national action: 

• Opening up all opportunities to those who are restricted by racial 
segregation and discrimination, and eliminating all barriers to 
their choice of jobs, education and housing. 

• Removing the frustration of powerlessness among the disad- 
vantaged by providing the means for them to deal with the prob- 
lems that affect their own lives, and by increasing the capacity of 
our public and private institutions to respond to these problems. 

• Increasing communication across racial lines to destroy stereo- 
types, to halt polarization, to end distrust and hostility, and to 
create common ground for efforts toward common goals of pub- 
lic order and social justice. 

There are those who oppose these aims as "rewarding the 
rioters." They are wrong. A great nation is not so easily in- 
timidated. We propose these aims to fulfill our pledge of 
equality and to meet the fundamental needs of a democratic, 
civilized society — domestic peace, social justice, and urban 
centers that are citadels of the human spirit. 

There are others who say that violence is necessary — that 
fear alone can prod the nation to act decisively on behalf 
of racial minorities. They too are wrong. Violence and dis- 
order compound injustice; they must be ended and they will 
be ended. 

Our strategy is neither blind repression nor capitulation 
to lawlessness. Rather it is the affirmation of common possi- 
bilities, for all, within a single society. 

I.  Employment 

Introduction 

Unemployment and underemployment are among the most 
persistent and serious grievances of our disadvantaged minori- 
ties. The pervasive effect of these conditions on the racial 
ghetto is inextricably linked to the problem of civil disorder. 

413 


In the Employment Act of 1946, the United States set for 
itself a national goal of a useful job at a reasonable wage for 
all who wish to work. Federal expenditures for manpower de- 
velopment and training have increased from less than $60 mil- 
lion in 1963 to $1.6 billion in 1968. The President has pro- 
posed a further increase to $2.1 billion in 1969 to provide work 
experience, training and supportive services for 1.3 million 
men and women. Despite these efforts, and despite sustained 
general economic prosperity and growing skill demands of 
automated industry, the goal of full employment has become 
increasingly hard to attain. 

Today there are about two million unemployed, and about 
ten million underemployed, 6.5 million of whom work full 
time and earn less than the annual poverty wage. 

The most compelling and difficult challenge is presented 
by some 500,000 "hard-core" unemployed who live within 
the central cities, lack a basic education, work not at all or 
only from time to time, and are unable to cope with the prob- 
lems of holding and performing a job. A substantial part of 
this group is Negro, male, and between the ages of approxi- 
mately 18 and 25. Members of this group are often among 
the initial participants in civil disorders. 

A slum employment study by the Department of Labor in 
1966 showed that, as compared with an unemployment rate 
for all persons in the United States of 3.8 percent, the un- 
employment rate among 16 to 19 year-old nonwhite males 
was 26.5 percent, and among 16 to 24 year-old nonwhite 
males 15.9 percent. Data collected by the Commission in 
cities where there were racial disorders in 1967 indicate that 
Negro males between the ages of 15 and 25 predominated 
among the rioters. More than 20 percent of the rioters were 
unemployed; and many of those who were employed worked 
in intermittent, low status, unskilled jobs — jobs which they 
regarded as below their level of education and ability. 

In the riot cities which we surveyed, Negroes were three 
times as likely as whites to hold unskilled jobs, which are 
often part time or seasonal, and "dead end" — a fact that's as 
significant for Negroes as unemployment. 

Goals and Objectives 

We propose a comprehensive national manpower policy 
to meet the needs of both the unemployed and the under- 
employed. That policy will require: 

• Continued emphasis on national economic growth and job crea- 

414 


tion so that there will be jobs available for those who are newly 
trained, without displacing those already employed. 

• Unified and intensive recruiting to reach those who need help 
with information about available job, training and supportive 
aids. 

• Careful evaluation of the individual's vocational skills, potentiate 
and needs; referral to one or more programs of basic education, 
job training and needed medical, social and other services; pro- 
vision for transportation between the ghetto and outlying em- 
ployment areas, and continued follow-up on the individual's 
progress until he no longer needs help. 

• Concentrated job training efforts, with major emphasis on on-the- 
job training by both public and private employers, as well as 
public and private vocational schools and other institutional 
facilities. 

• Opening up existing public and private job structures to provide 
greater upward mobility for the underemployed, without dis- 
placing anyone already employed at more advanced levels. 

• Large-scale development of new jobs in the public and private 
sectors to absorb as many as possible of the unemployed, again 
without displacement of the employed. 

• Stimulation of public and private investment in depressed areas, 
both urban and rural, to improve the environment, to alleviate 
unemployment and underemployment and, in rural areas, to 
provide for the poor alternatives other than migration to large 
urban centers. 

• New kinds of assistance for those who will continue to be at- 
tracted to the urban centers, both before and after they arrive. 

• Increasing small business and other entrepreneurial opportuni- 
ties in poverty areas, both urban and rural. 

Basic Strategies 

To achieve these objectives, we believe the following basic 
strategies should be adopted: 

• Existing programs aimed at recruiting, training and job develop- 
ment should be consolidated according to the function they serve 
at the local, state and federal levels, to avoid fragmentation and 
duplication. 

We need comprehensive and focused administration of a 
unified group of manpower programs. 

• High priority should be placed on the creation of new jobs in 
both the public and private sectors. 

In the public sector a substantial number of such jobs can 
be provided quickly, particularly by government at the local 
level, where there are vast unmet needs in education, health, 
recreation, public safety, sanitation, and other municipal serv- 
ices. The National Commission on Technology, Automation, 

415 


and Economic Progress estimated that there are 5.3 million 
potential jobs in public service. But the more difficult task 
is to provide jobs in private industry for the hard-core un- 
employed. Both strategies must be pursued simultaneously, 
with some arrangements for a flow of trainees from public 
sector jobs to on-the-job training in private companies. 

• Creation of jobs for the hard-core unemployed will require sub- 
stantial payments to both public and private employers to offset 
the extra costs of supportive services and training. 

Basic education and counseling in dress, appearance, social 
relationships, money management, transportation, hygiene and 
health, punctuality, and good work habits — all of which em- 
ployers normally take for granted — may have to be provided. 
Productivity may be low for substantial periods. 

• Special emphasis must be given to motivating the hard-core 
unemployed. 

A sure method for motivating the hard-core unemployed 
has not yet been devised. One fact, however, is already clear 
from the experience of the Job Corps, Neighborhood Youth 
Corps, and Manpower Development and Training projects: 
the previously hard-core unemployed trainee or employee must 
understand that he is not being trained for or offered a "dead- 
end" job. Since, by definition, he is not eligible even for an 
entry-level position, he must be given job training. He must 
be convinced that, if he performs satisfactorily, after the 
training period he will be employed and given an opportunity 
to advance, if possible, on a clearly defined "job ladder," with 
step increases in both pay and responsibility. 

• Artificial barriers to employment and promotion must be removed 
by both public agencies and private employers. 

Racial discrimination and unrealistic and unnecessarily high 
minimum qualifications for employment or promotion often 
have the same prejudicial effect. Government and business 
must consider for each type of job whether a criminal record 
should be a bar, and whether a high school diploma is an in- 
flexible prerequisite. During World War II, industry success- 
fully employed large numbers of the previously unemployed 
and disadvantaged by lowering standards and by restructuring 
work patterns so that the job fit the level of available skills. 
We believe that too often government, business and labor 
unions fail to take into account innate intelligence and apti- 
tudes which are not measurable. 

416 


Present recruitment procedures should be reexamined. Test- 
ing procedures should be revalidated or replaced by work 
sample or actual job tryouts. Applicants who are rejected for 
immediate training or employment should be evaluated and 
counseled by company personnel offcers and referred to either 
company or public remedial programs. These procedures have 
already been initiated in the steel and telephone industries. 

• Special training is needed for supervisory personnel. 

Support needed by the hard-core unemployed during initial 
job experience must be provided by specially-trained super- 
visors. A new program of training entry-level supervisors 
should be established by management, with government assist- 
ance if necessary. 

Suggested Programs 

We are proposing programs in six areas in order to illustrate 
how we believe the basic strategies we have outlined can be put 
into effect: 

• Consolidating and concentrating employment efforts. 

• Opening the existing job structure. 

• Creating one million new jobs in the public sector in three years. 

• Creating one million new jobs in the private sector in three years. 

• Developing urban and rural poverty areas. 

• Encouraging business ownership in the ghetto. 

• CONSOLIDATING AND CONCENTRATING EMPLOYMENT EFFORTS 
RECRUITMENT 

There is an urgent need for a comprehensive manpower 
recruitment and services agency at the community level. The 
Federal-State Employment Service is not serving this function 
in many urban areas and cannot do so unless it is substantially 
restructured and revitalized. This was recommended in 1965 
by the Employment Service Task Force but has been only 
partially achieved by the Employment Services' new Human 
Resources Development Program. 

We believe that every city should establish such a compre- 
hensive agency, with authority to direct the coordination of 
all manpower programs, including those of the Employment 
Service, the community action agencies, and other local groups. 

The Concentrated Employment Program established by the 
Department of Labor last year and now operating in the ghettos 
of 20 cities and in two rural areas is an important beginning 

417 


toward a unified effort at the local level. A related effort by 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development is under 
way in the Model Cities Program, now in the planning stage 
in some 63 cities. 

PLACEMENT 

In order to match men to jobs, we need more effective inter- 
change of information. A computerized nationwide service 
should be established, as recommended in 1966 by the Na- 
tional Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic 
Progress, with priority of installation given to the large urban 
centers. 

An information system of this sort would simplify place- 
ment— including inter-area placement and placement from 
ghetto to suburb. This in turn will often require transporta- 
tion assistance and counseling. 

The existing experimental mobility program, under the Man- 
power Development and Training Act, should be greatly ex- 
panded, and should support movement from one part of a 
metropolitan area to another. Aid to local public transpor- 
tation under the Mass Transportation Program should be 
similarly expanded on the basis of an existing experiment with 
subsidies for routes serving ghetto areas. 

Job development and placement in private industry is critical 
to our proposed strategies, and is now handled separately by 
a variety of agencies and programs: the Manpower Develop- 
ment and Training Act program, the vocational education pro- 
grams, the Vocational Rehabilitation program, the Job Corps 
and, recently, the Neighborhood Youth Corps and several new 
adult work experience and training programs. All seek to place 
trainees with private employers, sometimes with and some- 
times without training assistance, through a wide variety of 
local agencies, as well as through the Employment Service, 
community action agencies and others. 

A single cooperative national effort should be undertaken 
with the assistance of business, labor and industrial leaders at 
national, regional and local levels. It should reach both indi- 
vidual companies and trade associations, systematically and 
extensively, with information about incentive programs and 
aids, and with authority to negotiate contractual arrangements 
and channel incentive funds to private employers. 

The recently created Urban Coalition, with its local affiliates, 
brought together many of the interested parties in the private 
sector. The National Alliance of Businessmen just established 
by the President will be concentrating private industry efforts 
in on-the-job training of the hard-core unemployed. We believe 

418 


that it may be helpful now to create a federally-chartered 
corporation with authority to undertake the coordination of 
the private sector job program outlined below. 

• OPENING THE EXISTING JOB STRUCTURE 

Arbitrary barriers to employment and promotion must be 
eliminated. 

Federal, state and local efforts to ensure equal opportunity 
in employment should be strengthened by: 

(a) Including federal, state and local government agencies as 
employers covered by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 
the federal anti-discrimination-in-employment law, which now 
covers other employers of 50 or more employees (and as of July, 
1968 will cover employers of 25 or more employees), labor 
unions, and employment agencies. 

(b) Granting to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commis- 
sion, the federal enforcement agency under Title VII, cease and 
desist power comparable to the enforcement power now held by 
other federal agencies administering regulatory national policies. 

(c) Increasing technical and other assistance now provided 
through the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to state 
and local anti-discrimination commissions under the provisions 
of Title VII. 

(d) Undertaking, through the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission, an industry and areawide enforcement effort based 
not only upon individual complaints but upon employer and 
union reports showing broad patterns of discrimination in em- 
ployment and promotion. 

(e) Linking enforcement efforts with training and other aids to 
employers and unions, so that affirmative action to hire and pro- 
mote may be encouraged in connection with investigations of 
both individual complaints and charges of broad patterns of dis- 
crimination. 

(f ) Substantially increasing the staff and other resources of the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to enable it to per- 
form effectively these additional functions. 

Equal opportunity for employment by federal contractors 
under Executive Order 11246 should be enforced more vigor- 
ously against both employers and unions. This is particularly 
critical in regard to federal construction contracts. Staff and 
other resources of the Office of Contract Compliance in the 
Department of Labor should be increased so that withholding 
federal contracts is made a meaningful sanction. 

The efforts of the Department of Labor to obtain com- 
mitments from unions to encourage Negro membership in 
apprenticeship programs are especially noteworthy and should 
be intensified. 

Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which provides for 

419 


withholding federal grant-in-aid funds from activities which 
discriminate on grounds of color or race, should be supported 
fully, particularly in regard to recruitment for federally- 
assisted job training in hospitals, universities, colleges and 
schools. The staff and other resources of the Department of 
Health, Education and Welfare, which has primary jurisdiction 
over these functions, should be expanded for this purpose. 

The federal government, through the Civil Service Com- 
mission and other agencies, should undertake programs 
of recruitment, hiring and on-the-job training of the disad- 
vantaged and should reexamine and revalidate its minimum 
employment and promotion standards. In this regard the fed- 
eral government should become a model for state and local 
government and the private business community. To enlist the 
full cooperation of federal agencies, they should be reimbursed 
by internal allowances for the extra costs of training disad- 
vantaged employees. 

One way to improve the condition of the under-employed, 
on a national basis, would be to increase the federal minimum 
wage and widen its coverage. The recent increase to $1.60 per 
hour yields an annual wage only slightly above the poverty 
level and only for those employed full time. As an alternative, 
we recommend consideration be given to an experimental pro- 
gram of wage supplements or other methods for achieving the 
same income goals. 

•  CREATING ONE MILLION NEW JOBS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR 
IN THREE YEARS 

Existing public employment programs should be consoli- 
dated and substantially increased. The Neighborhood Youth 
Corps last year involved approximately 300,000 youths be- 
tween the ages of 14 and 22 in three programs of work experi- 
ence. NYC offers either full-time positions year-round or dur- 
ing the summer, or part-time positions during the school year. 
Several similar but considerably smaller public employment 
programs involve chronically unemployed adults, generally 
in subprofessional community betterment work: Operation 
Mainstream in small towns and rural areas; New Careers and 
Special Impact in urban areas; and Work Experience and 
Training for Welfare recipients under the 1967 Amendments 
to Title IV of the Social Security Act. 

Emphasis in the expanded public employment programs 
should be shifted, so far as possible, from work experience to 
on-the-job training, and additional federal assistance, above the 
present payment of 90 percent of wages, should be provided to 
pay for the additional costs of training and supportive services 

420 


to trainees. Federal assistance should be scaled so that it does 
not terminate abruptly; the public employer should pay a 
progressively larger share of the total cost as trainees' produc- 
tivity ^increases. 

Emphasis should also be placed on employing trainees to 
improve run-down neighborhoods and to perform variety of 
other socially useful public services which are not "make- 
work," including Community Service Officers in police depart- 
ments, as recommended by the President's Commission on Law 
Enforcement and Administration of Justice and as discussed 
above in Chapter 11. 

Public employers should be required to pay on-the-job train- 
ees not less than the minimum wage or the prevailing wage in 
the area for similar work, whichever is higher. We recommend 
a three-year program, aimed at creating 250,000 new public 
service jobs in the first year and a total of one million such 
jobs over the three-year period. 

The Department of Defense should (a) continue its em- 
phasis on (and consider expansion of) "Project 100,000" under 
which it accepts young men with below standard test scores; 
(b) intensify its recruiting efforts in areas of high unemploy- 
ment so that young men living there are fully aware of the 
training and service opportunities open to them and (c) sub- 
stantially expand Project Transition which began on a pilot 
basis in 1967 and involves training and counseling for service- 
men scheduled to return to civilian life. 

•  CREATING ONE MILLION NEW JOBS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
IN THREE YEARS 1 

Eighty-four percent of the nation's 73 million civilian work- 
ers are at work in 1 1 .5 million private enterprises. The involve- 
ment of only 5 percent of all private companies would repre- 
sent the use of more than 500,000 enterprises and provide a 
massive additional spur to job development. 

Based on experience with training by private employers, pri- 
marily under the Manpower Development and Training Act, 
our recommendations are aimed at inducing a substantially 
expanded number of companies to hire and train the hard-core 
unemployed. 

Recruitment and referral of the disadvantaged unemployed 
should be undertaken by a public body such as the manpower 
service agency we have already described. The manpower serv- 
ice agency would determine eligibility and certify a chronically 
unemployed person for on-the-job training by issuing to him a 

1 The text of the report to the Commission by its Advisory Panel on Private 
Enterprise is set forth as an appendix to this Report. 

421 


certificate of eligibility or similar identifying document. This 
would entitle the private employer to reimbursement for certain 
costs. A similar technique was used under the G. I. Bill for 
training veterans of World War II and the Korean conflict. 

The direct reimbursement system currently used in on-the- 
job training programs should be expanded and the existing 
programs should be consolidated under a single administration. 
These programs include the Manpower Development and 
Training Act and the new Work Training in Industry com- 
ponents of the Neighborhood Youth Corps, New Careers and 
Special Impact programs. Under these programs a federal 
agency contracts to reimburse each employer for a negotiated 
average cost of training and supportive services for each 
trainee. 

If a corporation is chartered by Congress to serve as the 
government's primary instrument for job development in the 
private sector, the corporation, through regional and local 
subsidiaries, would: 

(a) systematically work with trade groups, companies and labor 
unions; 

(b) arrange for any necessary supportive services and prevoca- 
tional educational training which employers are unable to provide; 
and 

(c) enter into contracts with employers providing for their re* 
imbursement for the extra costs of training. 

The employer would of course undertake not to dismiss exist- 
ing employees in order to hire trainees; to provide job training 
along with supportive services: and to give reasonable assur- 
ance that the employee would be fairly promoted if he suc- 
cessfully completed his training period. 

To serve as an incentive to widespread business involve- 
ment the average amount of the reimbursement must exceed 
substantially the approximately $1,000 per year payment now 
made under federal on-the-job training programs and, for the 
hard-core unemployed, should at least equal the $3,500 recom- 
mended by the President in his Manpower Message of January 
23, 1968. 

An additional and potentially lower cost method of stimu- 
lating on-the-job training and new job creation for the hard- 
core unemployed is through a tax credit system, provided that 
guidelines are adopted to ensure adequate training and job 
retention. The Commission believes this alternative holds 
promise. With respect to the tax credit device, we note that 
since its enactment in 1962 the existing 7 percent incentive 
credit for investment in new equipment and machinery has 
been highly successful as a technique for reaching a large num- 

422 


ber of individual enterprises to effectuate a national policy. 
During the 1962-65 period the credit was taken on 1,239,000 
corporate tax returns representing new investment in the 
amount of approximately $75 billion. 

To assure comparable simplicity in administration, the tax 
credit should be geared to a fixed amount for each certificated 
employee hired and retained at least for a six-month period, 
with decreasing credits for retention for additional periods 
totaling another 18 months. No credit would be allowed if 
existing employees are displaced, or if the turnover rate among 
certificated employees during each period exceeds more than 
twice the employer's usual turnover rate. 

The corporation chartered by Congress would establish per- 
formance guidelines, compare and evaluate the results of job 
training operations by contract and under the tax credit and 
arrange to share with all participating employers the experi- 
ences of other companies with techniques for training the hard- 
core unemployed and holding them on the job. 

The Commission recommends a three-year program, aimed 
at creating 300,000 new private sector jobs in the first year and 
a total of one million such jobs over the three-year period, 
provided that the tax credit is enacted at an early date. If the 
tax credit is not so enacted, a realistic goal would be 150,000 
such jobs in the first year and one million jobs over a three to 
five-year period. 

• DEVELOPING URBAN AND RURAL POVERTY AREAS 2 

A tax credit should also be provided for the location and 
renovation of plants and other business facilities in urban and 
rural "poverty areas," as already defined jointly by several 
federal departments and agencies. 

The existing incentive tax credit for investment in new equip- 
ment (but not for real property or plant) is available with- 
out regard to where the investment is made. For investment 
in poverty areas, the existing credit should be increased sub- 
stantially and extended to investments in real property and 
plant, whether for the construction of a new plant or the acqui- 
sition of an existing facility. Plant and equipment in these areas 
should also be eligible for rapid amortization, within as little 
as five years. 

These incentives would be designed to attract to the poverty 
areas the kind of industrial and commercial development which 
would create new jobs and provide other economic benefits for 

fiThe Commission invites particular attention to Chapters 3 and 4 of "The 
People Left Behind," a Report by the President's National Advisory Com- 
mission on Rural Poverty, September, 1967. 

423 


the disadvantaged community surrounding the enterprise. An 
employer eligible for the poverty area investment credit would 
also be eligible — if he employed certificated trainees — for the 
hard-core employment credit. The two credits are designed to 
meet separate needs and different costs to investors and 
employers. 

To begin an intensified national effort to improve rural 
economic conditions and to stem the flow of migration from 
these areas to large urban centers, the new investment credit 
should also be available for firms investing or expanding in 
rural poverty areas. 

The authority and the resources of the Economic Develop- 
ment Administration should be enlarged to enable it to ex- 
pand its operations into urban poverty areas on a substantial 
scale. 

•  ENCOURAGING BUSINESS OWNERSHIP IN THE GHETTO 

We believe it is important to give special encouragement to 
Negro ownership of business in ghetto areas. The disad- 
vantaged need help in obtaining managerial experience and in 
creating for themselves a stake in the economic community. 
The advantages of Negro entrepreneurship also include self- 
employment and jobs for others. 

Existing Small Business Administration equity and operating 
loan programs, under which almost 3,500 loans were made 
during fiscal year 1967, should be substantially expanded in 
amount, extended to higher risk ventures and promoted widely 
through offices in the ghetto. Loans under Small Business Ad- 
ministration guarantees, which are now authorized, should be 
actively encouraged among local lending institutions. 

Counseling and managerial assistance should also be pro- 
vided. The new Department of Commerce program under 
which Negro small businessmen are assisted in creating asso- 
ciations for pooling purchasing power and sharing experience, 
should be expanded and consolidated with the Small Business 
Administration loan program. The Interracial Council for 
Business Opportunity and other private efforts to provide coun- 
seling by successful businessmen outside the ghetto should be 
supported and enlarged. 

II. Education 

Introduction 

Education in a democratic society must equip the children of 
the nation to realize their potential and to participate fully in 

424 


American life. For the community at large, the schools have 
discharged this responsibility well. But for many minorities, 
and particularly for the children of the racial ghetto, the 
schools have failed to provide the educational experience which 
could help overcome the effects of discrimination and de- 
privation. 

This failure is one of the persistent sources of grievance 
and resentment within the Negro community. The hostility of 
Negro parents and students toward the school system is gen- 
erating increasing conflict and causing disruption within many 
city school districts. 

But the most dramatic evidence of the relationship between 
educational practices and civil disorder lies in the high inci- 
dence of riot participation by ghetto youth who had not com- 
pleted high school. Our survey of riot cities found that the 
typical riot participant was a high school dropout. As Super- 
intendent Briggs of Cleveland testified before the Commission: 

"Many of those whose recent acts threaten the domestic safety 
and tear at the roots of the American democracy are the products 
of yesterday's inadequate and neglected inner-city schools. The 
greatest unused and underdeveloped human resources in America 
are to be found in the deteriorating cores of America's urban 
centers." 

The bleak record of public education for ghetto children 
is growing worse. In the critical skills — verbal and reading 
ability — Negro students fall further behind whites with each 
year of school completed. For example, in the metropolitan 
Northeast Negro students on the average begin the first grade 
with somewhat lower scores on standard achievement tests 
than white, are about 1.6 grades behind by the sixth grade, and 
have fallen 3.3 grades behind white students by the twelfth 
grade.3 The failure of the public schools to equip these students 
with basic verbal skills is reflected in their performance on the 
Selective Service Mental Test. During the period June 1964- 
December 1965, 67 percent of Negro candidates failed the 
examination. The failure rate for whites was 19 percent. 

The result is that many more Negro than white students 
drop out of school. In the metropolitan North and West, Negro 
students are more than three times as likely as white students 
to drop out of school by age 16-17.4 As reflected by the high 
unemployment rate for graduates of ghetto schools and the 

8 "Equality of Educational Opportunity," U. S. Department of HEW, Office 
of Education (1966), p. 20. This report, generally referred to as the "Coleman 
Report," was prepared pursuant to Section 402 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

cent, as opposed to 6 percent for white students. Coleman Report, p. 31. 

425 


even higher proportion of employed workers who are in 
low-skilled, low-paid jobs, many of those who do graduate 
are not equipped to enter the normal job market, and have 
great difficulty securing employment.5 

Several factors have converged to produce this critical 
situation. 

Segregation 

The vast majority of inner-city schools are rigidly segre- 
gated. In 75 major central cities surveyed by the U.S. Com- 
mission on Civil Rights in its study, "Racial Isolation in the 
Public Schools," 75 percent of all Negro students in elementary 
grades attended schools with enrollments that were 90 percent 
or more Negro. Almost 90 percent of all Negro students 
attended schools which had a majority of Negro students. In 
the same cities, 83 percent of all white students in those grades 
attended schools with 90 to 100 percent white enrollments. 

Racial isolation in the urban public schools is the result 
principally of residential segregation and widespread employ- 
ment of the "neighborhood school" policy, which transfers 
segregation from housing to education. The effect of these 
conditions is magnified by the fact that a much greater pro- 
portion of white than Negro students attend private schools. 
Studies indicate that in America's twenty largest cities approxi- 
mately four out of ten white students are enrolled in nonpublic 
schools, as compared with only one out of ten Negro pupils. 
The differential appears to be increasing.6 

Segregation in urban schools is growing. In a sample of 
15 large Northern cities, the Civil Rights Commission found 
that the degree of segregation rose sharply from 1950 to 
1965. As Negro enrollments in these 15 cities grew, 97 per- 
cent of the increase was absorbed by schools already over 
50 percent Negro and 84 percent by schools more than 90 
percent Negro.7 By 1975, it is estimated that, if current policies 

5 Employment figures reflect discriminatory practices as well. The contribu- 
tion of inadequate education to unemployment, while not quantified, is clearly 
substantial.

bery, National Conference on Equal Educational Opportunity, November, 
1967, p. 3. 

7 While the proportion of Negroes attending all-Negro schools in Southern 
and border states has declined in the 14 years since the Supreme Court's school 
desegregation decision, the number of Negro students attending schools with 
all or nearly all Negro enrollments has risen. "Racial Isolation in the Public 
Schools," p. 10. 

426 


and trends persist, 80 percent of all Negro pupils in the twenty 
largest cities, comprising nearly one-half of the nation's Negro 
population, will be attending 90 to 100 percent Negro schools.8 

Segregation has several major effects that have acted to 
reduce the quality of education provided in schools serving 
disadvantaged Negro neighborhoods. 

Most of the residents of these areas are poor. Many of the 
adults, the product of the inadequate, rural school systems 
of the South,9 have low levels of educational attainment. Their 
children have smaller vocabularies, and are not as well 
equipped to learn rapidly in school — particularly with respect 
to basic literary skills — as children from more advantaged 
homes. 

When disadvantaged children are racially isolated in the 
schools, they are deprived of one of the more significant in- 
gredients of quality education: exposure to other children 
with strong educational backgrounds. The Coleman Report 
and the Report of the Civil Rights Commission establish that 
the predominant socio-economic background of the students 
in a school exerts a powerful impact upon achievement. Fur- 
ther, the Coleman Report found that "if a minority pupil 
from a home without much educational strength is put with 
schoolmates with strong educational backgrounds, his achieve- 
ment is likely to increase."10 

Another strong influence on achievement derives from the 
tendency of school administrators, teachers, parents and the 
students themselves to regard ghetto schools as inferior. Re- 
flecting this attitude, students attending such schools lose con- 
fidence in their ability to shape their future. The Coleman 
Report found this factor — destiny control — "to have a stronger 
relationship to achievement than ... all the 'school' factors 
together" and to be "related, for Negroes, to the proportion of 
whites in the schools."11 

In other words, both class and race factors have a strong 

8 "Big City School Desegregation: Trends and Methods," supra. 

9 The poor quality of education offered in these schools, located in the most 
poverty stricken section of the country, is attested to by the fact that "the 
12th-grade Negro in the nonmetropolitan South is 0.8 standard deviation be- 
low— or, in terms of years, 1.9 years behind — the Negro in the Metropolitan 
Northeast ..." Coleman Report, p. 21. 

10 This finding was limited to performance of students from minority groups. 
The Coleman Report states: 

"if a white pupil from a home that is strongly and effectively supportive of 
education is put in a school where most pupils do not come from such 
homes, his achievement will be little different than if he were in a school 
composed of others like himself." p. 22 

11 Coleman Report, p. 23. 

427 


bearing on educational achievement; the ghetto student labors 
under a double burden. 

Teachers 

The schools attended by disadvantaged Negro children com- 
monly are staffed by teachers with less experience and lower 
qualifications than those attended by middle-class whites.12 For 
example, a 1963 study ranking Chicago's public high schools 
by the socio-economic status of surrounding neighborhoods 
found that in the 10 lowest-ranking schools only 63.2 percent 
of all teachers were fully certified and the median level of 
teaching experience was 3.9 years. In three of these schools, 
the median level was one year. Four of these lowest ranking 
schools were 100 percent Negro in enrollment and three were 
over 90 percent Negro. By contrast eight of the ten highest 
ranking schools had nearly total white enrollments, and the 
other two were more than 75 percent white. In these schools, 
90.3 percent of the teachers were fully certified and the median 
level of teaching experience was 12.3 years. 

Testifying before the Commission, Dr. Daniel Dodson, Di- 
rector of the New York University Center for Human Re- 
lations and Community Services, stated that: 

"Inner-city schools have not been able to hold teaching staff. 
Between 1952 and 1962 almost half the licensed teachers of New 
York City left the system. Almost two out of every five of the 
50,000 teaching personnel of New York City do not hold regu- 
lar permanent licenses for the assignments they have. 

"In another school system in one of the large cities, it was re- 
ported of one inner-city school that of 84 staff members, 41 were 
temporary teachers, 25 were probationaries and 18 [were] tenure 
teachers. However, only one of the tenure teachers was licensed 
in academic subjects." 

U.S. Commissioner of Education, Harold Howe, testified 
that many teachers are unprepared for teaching in schools 
serving disadvantaged children, "have what is a traumatic 
experience there and don't last." Moreover, the more experi- 

12 The Civil Rights Commission's survey found no major national differences 
in the educational attainment (years completed) of teachers in majority-Negro 
or majority-white schools. However, many large cities did not take part in the 
basic studies which supplied the data* for this conclusion. It is precisely in 
these cities that teachers of disadvantaged Negro students tend to be the least 
experienced. Moreover, the Commission did conclude that Negro students, 
more often than whites, had teachers with non-academic college majors and 
lower verbal achievement levels. 

428 


cnced teachers normally select schools in white neighborhoods, 
thereby relegating the least experienced teachers to the dis- 
advantaged schools. This process reinforces the view of ghetto 
schools as inferior. 

As a result, teachers assigned to these schools often begin 
with negative attitudes toward the students, and, their ability 
and willingness to learn. These attitudes are aggravated by 
serious discipline problems, by the high crime rates in areas 
surrounding the schools, and by the greater difficulties of teach- 
ing students from disadvantaged backgrounds. These condi- 
tions are reflected in the Coleman Report's finding that a higher 
proportion of teachers in schools serving disadvantaged areas 
are dissatisfied with their present assignments and with their 
students than are their counterparts in other schools.13 

Studies have shown that the attitudes of teachers toward 
their students have very powerful impacts upon educational 
attainment. The more teachers expect from their students — 
however disadvantaged those students may be — the better the 
students perform. Conversely, negative teacher attitudes act 
as self-fulfilling prophecies: the teachers expect little from their 
students; the students fulfill the expectation. As Dr. Kenneth 
Clark observed, "Children who are treated as if they are 
uneducable invariably become uneducable."14 

In disadvantaged areas, the neighborhood school concept 
tends to concentrate a relatively high proportion of emotion- 
ally disturbed and other problem children in the schools. Dis- 
advantaged neighborhoods have the greatest need for health 
personnel, supplementary instructors and counsellors to assist 
with family problems, provide extra instruction to lagging stu- 
dents and deal with the many serious mental and physical 
health deficiencies that occur so often in poverty areas. 

These conditions which make effective teaching vastly more 
difficult, reinforce negative teacher attitudes. A 1963 survey 
of Chicago public schools showed that the condition creating 
the highest amount of dissatisfaction among teachers was lack 
of adequate provision for the treatment of maladjusted, re- 
tarded and disturbed pupils. About 79 percent of elementary 
school teachers and 67 percent of high school teachers named 
this item as a key factor. The need for professional support 
for teachers in dealing with these extraordinary problems is 
seldom, if ever, met. 

Although special schools or classes are available for emo-

429 


tionally disturbed and mentally handicapped children, many 
pupils requiring such help remain in regular classes because 
of negligence, red tape or unavailability of clinical staff. An 
example is provided by a National Education Association 
Study of Detroit:15 

Before a disturbed child can receive psychological assistance, he 
must receive diagnostic testing. But before this happens, the 
teacher must fill in a form ... to be submitted ... to a central 
office committee ... If the committee decides that psychological 
testing is in order, the teacher must fill out a second form . . . 
to be submitted to the psychological clinic. The child may then 
be placed on the waiting Ust for psychological testing. The wait- 
ing period may last for several weeks, several months, or several 
years. And while he waits, he 'sits in' the regular classroom . . . 
Since visiting teachers are scarce and special classes insufficient 
in number, the child who has been tested is usually returned to 
the regular classroom to serve more time as a 'sit-in.' 

Teaching in disadvantaged areas is made more difficult by 
the high rate of student turnover. In New York City during 
1963-1964, seven of ten students in the average, segregated 
Negro-Puerto Rican elementary school either entered or left 
during the year.16 Similar conditions are common to other 
inner-city schools. Continuity of education becomes exceed- 
ingly difficult — the more so because many of the students 
entering ghetto schools during the school year come from rural 
southern schools and are behind even the minimum levels of 
achievement attained by their fellow northern-born students. 

Enrollments 

In virtually every large American city, the inner city schools 
attended by Negroes are the most overcrowded. We have cited 
the vast population exchange — relatively affluent whites leav- 
ing the city to be replaced by Negroes — which has taken place 
over the last decade. The impact on public education facilities 
has been severe. 

Despite an overall decrease in the population of many cities, 
school enrollment has increased. Over the last 15 years, De- 
troit has lost approximately 20,000 to 30,000 families. Yet 
during that same period the public school system gained ap- 
proximately 50,000 to 60,000 children. Between 1961 and 
1965, Detroit's Negro public school enrollment increased by 
31,108, while white enrollment dropped 23,748. In Cleveland 

16 "Detroit, Michigan: A Study of Barriers txxEqual Educational Opportunity 
in a Large City," National Commission on Professional Rights and Respon- 
sibilities of the National Education Association of the United States, March, 
1967, p. 66. 

16 The comparable rate in the white schools was four out of ten. 

430 


between 1950 and 1965, a population loss of 130,000 coincided 
with a school enrollment increase of 50,000. Enrollment gains 
in New York City and Chicago were even larger. 

Although of lesser magnitude, similar changes have oc- 
curred in the public school systems of many other large cities. 
As white students withdraw from a public school, they are re- 
placed by a greater number of Negro students. This reflects 
the fact that the Negro population is relatively younger, has 
more children of school age, makes less use of private schools, 
and is more densely concentrated than the white population. 

As a result, Negro school enrollments have increased even 
more rapidly than the total Negro population in central cities. 
In Cincinnati, for example, between 1960 and 1965 the Negro 
population grew 16 percent, while Negro public school en- 
rollment increased 26 percent.17 The following data for four 
other cities illustrate how the proportion of Negroes in public 
schools has outgrown the Negro proportion of the total city 
population.18

Because this rapid expansion of Negro population has been 
concentrated in segregated neighborhoods, ghetto schools have 
experienced acute overcrowding. Shortages of textbooks and 
supplies have developed. Double shifts are common; hallways 
and other non-classroom space have been adapted for class 
instruction; and mobile classroom units are used. Even pro- 
grams for massive construction of new schools in Negro 
neighborhoods cannot always keep up with increased over- 
crowding. 

432 


From 1951 to 1963, the Chicago Board of Education built 
266 new schools or additions, mainly in all-Negro areas. Yet 
a special committee studying the schools in 1964 reported 
that 40 percent of the Negro elementary schools had more 
than 35 students per available classroom, as compared to 12 
percent of the primarily white elementary schools. Of the 
eight Negro high schools, five had enrollments over 50 percent 
above designed capacity. Four of the 10 integrated high 
schools, but only four of the 26 predominantly white high 
schools, were similarly overcrowded. Comparable conditions 
prevail in many other large cities. 

The Civil Rights Commission found that two-thirds of the 
predominantly Negro elementary schools in Atlanta were over- 
crowded. This compared with 47 percent of the white schools. 
In 1965, all Atlanta Negro high schools were operating be- 
yond their designed capacity; only one of three all-white 
high schools, and six of eight predominantly white schools were 
similarly overcrowded.19 

Washington, D. C. elementary schools with 85-100 percent 
Negro enrollments operated at a median of 115 percent of 
capacity. The one predominantly white high school operated 
at 92.3 percent, an integrated high school at 101.1 percent, 
and the remaining schools — all predominantly Negro — at 
108.4 percent to 127.1 percent of capacity. 

Overcrowded schools have severe effects on education, the 
most important of which is that teachers are forced to concen- 
trate on maintaining classroom discipline, and thus have little 
time and energy to perform their primary function — educating 
the students. 

Facilities and Curricula 

Inner-city schools are not only overcrowded, they also tend 
to be the oldest and most poorly equipped. 

In Detroit, 30 of the school buildings still in use in these 
areas were dedicated during the administration of President 
Grant.20 In Cincinnati, although from 1950 to 1965, Negro 
student population expanded at a faster pace than white, most 
additional school capacity planned and constructed was in 
predominantly white areas. According to a Civil Rights Com- 
mission report on Cincinnati, the added Negro pupil popula- 
tion was housed, for the most part, in the same central-city 
schools vacated by the whites.21

With respect to equipment, the Coleman Report states that 
"Negro pupils have fewer of some of the facilities that seem 
most related to achievement: They have less access to physics, 
chemistry, and language laboratories; there are fewer books 
per pupil in their libraries; their textbooks are less often in 
sufficient supply."22 

The quality of education offered by ghetto schools is di- 
minished further by use of curricula and materials poorly 
adapted to the life-experiences of their students. Designed to 
serve a middle-class culture, much educational material ap- 
pears irrelevant to the youth of the racial and economic ghetto. 
Until recently, few texts featured any Negro personalities. Few 
books used or courses offered reflected the harsh realities of 
life in the ghetto, or the contribution of Negroes to the coun- 
try's culture and history. This failure to include materials 
relevant to their own environment has made students skeptical 
about the utility of what they are being taught. Reduced moti- 
vation to learn results. 

Funds 

Despite the overwhelming need, our society spends less 
money educating ghetto children than children of suburban 
families. Comparing the per capita education costs for ghetto 
and suburban schools — one educator, in testimony before this 
Commission, said: 

If the most educated parents with the highest motivated children 
find in their wisdom that it costs $1,500 per child per year to 
educate their children in the suburbs, isn't it logical that it would 
cost an equal amount to educate the less well motivated, low- 
income family child in the inner city? Such cost would just about 
double the budget of the average inner-city school system.28 

Twenty-five school boards in communities surrounding De- 
troit spent up to $500 more per pupil per year to educate 
their children than the city. Merely to bring the teacher/pupil 
ratio in Detroit in line with the state average would require 
an additional 1,650 teachers at an annual cost of approxi- 
mately $13 million.24 

There is evidence that the disparity in educational expend- 
itures for suburban and inner-city schools has developed 
in parallel with population shifts. In a study of twelve metro- 
politan areas,  the Civil Rights Commission found that, in 

22 Coleman report, pp. 9-12. 
28 Testimony of Dr. Dodson. 

** Testimony of Norman Drachler, Superintendent of Schools, Detroit. 

434 


1950, 10 of the 12 central cities spent more per pupil than 
the surrounding suburbs; by 1964, in seven of the 12 the aver- 
age suburb spent more per pupil than the central city in 
seven.25 

This reversal reflects the declining or stagnant city tax base, 
and increasing competition from nonschool meeds (police, 
welfare, fire) for a share of the municipal tax dollar. The 
suburbs, where nonschool needs are less demanding, allocate 
almost twice the proportion of their total budgets to education 
as the cities.26 

State contributions to city school systems have not had con- 
sistent equalizing effects. The Civil Rights Commission found 
that, although state aid to city schools has increased at a rate 
proportionately greater than for suburban schools, states con- 
tinue to contribute more per pupil to suburban schools in 
seven of the twelve metropolitan areas studied. The following 
table illustrates the findings:

Federal assistance, while focused on the innercity schools, 
has not been at a scale sufficient to remove the disparity. In 
the 1965-1966 school year, federal aid accounted for less than 
8 percent of total educational expenditures. Our survey of 
federal programs in Detroit, Newark and New Haven during 
the school year 1967-1968 found that a median of approxi- 
mately half the eligible school population is receiving assistance 
under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
(ESEA). 

Community School Relations 

Teachers of the poor rarely live in the community where they 
work and sometimes have little sympathy for the life styles of 
their students. Moreover, the growth and complexity of the 
administration of large urban school systems has compromised 
the accountability of the local schools to the communities which 
they serve, and reduced the ability of parents to influence de- 
cisions affecting the education of their children. Ghetto schools 
often appear to be unresponsive to the community, communi- 
cation has broken down, and parents are distrustful of educa- 
tion officials. 

The consequences for the education of students attending 
these schools are serious. Parental hostility to the schools is 
reflected in the attitudes of their children. Since the needs and 
concerns of the ghetto community are rarely reflected in edu- 
cational policy formulated on a citywide basis, the schools are 
often seen by ghetto youth as being irrelevant. 

On the basis of interviews of riot area residents in Detroit, 
Dr. Charles Smith, of the U.S. Office of Education's compre- 
hensive elementary and secondary education program, testified 
that "one of the things that came through very clearly to us 
is the fact that there is an attitude which prevails in the inner 
city that says in substance we think education is irrelevant." 

Dr. Dodson explained this phenomenon as follows: 

"This divergence of goals [between the dominant class and ghetto 
youth] makes schools irrelevant for the youth of the slum. It 
removes knowledge as a tool for groups who are deviant to the 
ethos of the dominant society. It tends to destroy the sense of 
self-worth of minority background children. It breeds apathy, 
powerlessness and low self-esteem. The majority of ghetto youth 
would prefer to forego the acquisition of knowledge if it is at that 
cost. One cannot understand the alienation of modern ghetto 
youth except in the context of this conflict of goals." 

The absence of effective community-school relations has 

436 


deprived the public education system of the communication 
required to overcome this divergence of goals. In the schools, 
as in the larger society, the isolation of ghetto residents from the 
policy-making institutions of local government is adding to 
the polarization of the community and depriving the system 
of its self -rectifying potential. 

Ghetto Environment 

All of the foregoing factors contribute substantially to the 
poor performance of ghetto schools. Inadequate and inefficient 
as these schools are, the failure of the public education system 
with respect to Negro students cannot fully be appraised apart 
from the constant and oppressive ghetto environment. 

The interaction of the ghetto environment and the schools 
is well described in the testimony of Superintendent Briggs of 
Cleveland: 

"But what about the child of the ghetto? It is he whom we must 
save for we cannot afford to lose this generation of young Amer- 
icans. 

"If this child of despair is a young adult, there is a better than 
a 50 percent chance that he is a high school dropout He is not 
only unemployed, but unemployable, without a salable skill. 
Neither of his parents went beyond the eighth grade. Preschool 
or nursery school was out of the question when he was four, and 
when he was five he was placed on a kindergarten waiting list. 
... At six he entered school; but could only attend for half a day 
because of the big enrollment . . . During his six years in ele- 
mentary school, he attended four different schools because the 
family moved often, seeking more adequate housing for the six 
children. When he got to high school he wanted vocational train- 
ing, but none was available. 

'The family was on relief and he couldn't afford a good lunch 
at noon because Cleveland schools at that time were not partici- 
pating in the federal hot lunch program and the average cost of 
lunches amounted to 70 cents. 

"Of his few friends who were graduated from high school none 
had found jobs and they couldn't afford to go to college. 

"Here he is now, discouraged and without hope — economically 
incompetent at a time in life when, traditionally, young Ameri- 
cans have entered the economic mainstream as job holders. 

"A younger brother, age 9, is now in the fourth grade. He at- 
tends a new school, opened in 1964. Though he lives one mile 
from Lake Erie, he has never seen it He has never taken a bus 
ride, except when his class at school went on a field trip. The 
family still does not subscribe to a daily newspaper. The tele- 
vision set is broken and there is no money to have it repaired. 
His mother has never taken him downtown shopping. 

437 


"He has never been in the office of a dentist and has seen a 
physician only at the local clinic when he was injured playing in 
an abandoned house in the neighborhood. 

"At home there are no books. His toys, if any, are secondhand. 
His shoes are too small and his sweat shirt, bought for 25 cents 
at a rummage sale, bears the insignia of a suburban school 
system. 

"Each morning he looks forward anxiously to the free milk he 
gets at school because there is no breakfast at home. 

"He can't study well at home because of the loud blare of rock- 
and-roll music from the bar up the street. There are nine bars in 
his rather compact neighborhood. . . . 

"The screaming police siren is a very familiar sound to him 
for he hears it regularly in his neighborhood, where the crime 
rate is Cleveland's highest. 

"These boys both have better than average intelligence but 
they are the victims of neglect and are lost in the maze of statis- 
tics. Their plight and that of thousands like them in America's 
ghettos can certainly be considered the most pressing unattended 
business on America's agenda." 

Basic Strategies 

To meet the urgent need to provide full equality of educa- 
tional opportunity for disadvantaged youth, we recommend 
pursuit of the following strategies: 

• Increasing efforts to eliminate de facto segregation. 

We have cited the extent of racial isolation in our urban 
schools. It is great and it is growing. It will not easily to over- 
come. Nonetheless, we believe school integration to be vital 
to the well-being of this country. 

We base this conclusion not on the effect of racial and 
economic segregation on achievement of Negro students, al- 
though there is evidence of such a relationship; nor on the effect 
of racial isolation on the even more segregated white students, 
although lack of opportunity to associate with persons of differ- 
ent ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds surely limits their 
learning experience. 

We support integration as the priority education strategy 
because it is essential to the future of American society. We 
have seen in this last summer's disorders the consequences of 
racial isolation, at all levels, and of attitudes toward race, on 
both sides, produced by three centuries of myth, ignorance and 
bias. It is indispensable that opportunities for interaction be- 
tween the races be expanded. "The problems of this society 
will not be solved unless and until our children are brought 

438 


into a common encounter and encouraged to forge a new and 
more viable design of life." 27 

• Provision of quality education for ghetto schools. 

We recognize that the growing dominance of pupils from 
disadvantaged minorities in city populations will not soon be re- 
versed. No matter how great the effort toward desegregation, 
many children of the ghetto will not, within their school 
careers, attend integrated schools. 

If existing disadvantages are not to be perpetuated, we must 
improve dramatically the quality of ghetto education. Equality 
of results with all-white schools in terms of achievement must 
be the goal. 

We see no conflict between the integration and quality educa- 
tion strategies we espouse. Commitment to the goal of inte- 
grated education can neither diminish the reality of today's 
segregated and unequal ghetto schools nor sanction the tragic 
waste of human resources which they entail. 

Far from being in conflict, the strategies are complementary. 
The aim of quality education is to compensate for and over- 
come the environmental handicaps of disadvantaged children. 
The evidence indicates that integration, in itself, does not 
wholly achieve this purpose. Assessing his report in light of 
interpretation by others of its findings, Dr. Coleman concludes 
that: 

"it is also true that even in socially or racially integrated schools 
a child's family background shows a very high relation to his 
performance. The findings of the [Coleman] Report are quite 
unambiguous on this score. Even if the school is integrated, the 
heterogeneity of backgrounds with which children enter school 
is largely preserved in the heterogeneity of their performance 
when they finish. As the Report indicates, integration provides 
benefits to the underprivileged. But it takes only a small step to- 
ward equality of educational opportunity." * 

Moreover, most large integrated schools retain a form of 
ability grouping, normally resulting in resegregation along 
racial lines. The Civil Rights Commission found that "many 
Negro students who attend majority-white schools in fact are 
in majority-Negro classrooms." 29 

In short, compensatory education is essential not only to 
improve the quality of education provided in segregated ghetto 
schools, but to make possible both meaningful integration and 
maximum achievement in integrated schools.

1967, p. 23.

439 


Attainment of this goal will require adoption of a compre- 
hensive approach designed to reconstruct the ghetto child's 
social and intellectual environment, compensate for disadvan- 
tages already suffered and provide necessary tools for develop- 
ment of essential literary skills. This approach will entail adop- 
tion of new and costly educational policies and practices be- 
ginning with early childhood and continuing through elemen- 
tary and secondary schools. It will require extraordinary efforts 
to reconnect parents with the schools. It will also require 
unique experimentation with new methods to bring back into 
the educational process street-oriented teenagers and sub- 
teenagers who have lost all connection with existing school 
institutions. 

• Improving community-school relations. 

In an atmosphere of hostility between the community and 
the schools, education cannot flourish. A basic problem stems 
from the isolation of the schools from the other social forces 
influencing youth. Changes in society — mass media, family 
structure, religion — have radically altered the role of the 
school. New links must be built between the schools and the 
communities they serve. The schools must be related to the 
broader system which influences and educates ghetto youth. 

Expansion of opportunities for community and parental 
participation in the school system is essential to the successful 
functioning of the inner-city schools. 

• Expanding opportunities for higher and vocational opportunities. 

To increase the relevance of education to the needs and 
aspirations of disadvantaged youth and to prepare them for 
full participation in American society, we recommend expand- 
ing opportunities both for higher education and for vocational 
training. 

Suggested Programs 

• INCREASING EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE DE FACTO SEGREGATION 

INCREASED AID TO SCHOOL SYSTEMS SEEKING TO ELIMINATE 
DE FACTO SEGREGATION EITHER WITHIN THE SYSTEM OR IN 
COOPERATION WITH NEIGHBORING SCHOOL SYSTEMS 

Local school boards have experimented with a variety of 
techniques designed to accomplish desegregation. Among those 

440 


commonly employed are school pairing, busing, open enroll- 
ment, boundary changes, strategic use of site selection, en- 
largement of attendance areas, and consolidation of schools 
to overcome racial imbalance. The results have not been uni- 
form. Much appears to depend on the size and racial com- 
position of the city and the attitudes of its suburbs. 

Some of the smaller cities have achieved considerable suc- 
cess. In many of our larger cities, however, the population 
shift earlier described has proceeded so far that integration 
is not feasible without the active cooperation of suburban 
communities. In others, distances between the white and Negro 
populations living within city boundaries make these methods 
of accomplishing integration unfeasible. While the desegrega- 
tion technique best suited for it should be determined by each 
community we believe substantial federal assistance should be 
provided. 

TITLE IV 

Under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the U.S. 
Commissioner of Education is authorized to provide "technical 
assistance to . . . [state and local education agencies] in the 
preparation, adoption, and implementation of plans for the 
desegregation of public schools." However, such aid is not 
available in support of locally-designed programs to overcome 
racial imbalance in the schools. Moreover, this program has 
never been adequately funded, even to accomplish its limited 
objectives. Applications for Title IV funds have consistently 
exceeded the amounts requested by the Administration and 
the far lower sums appropriated by the Congress. 

We believe that the Title IV program should be reoriented 
and expanded into a major federal effort to provide com- 
prehensive aid to support state and local desegregation projects. 

To accomplish this purpose, Title IV should become the 
vehicle for a comprehensive federal construction, technical 
assistance and operating grant program. Successful implemen- 
tation of such a program will require repeal of the present 
statutory prohibition against provision of assistance to support 
and encourage desegregation through "assignment of students 
to public schools in order to overcome racial imbalance." To 
stimulate needed planning, formulation of long-term integra- 
tion plans by applicant state and local agencies should be 
required as a condition to receiving assistance. Title IV aid 
would be available only for projects which promote integrated 
education in accordance with such plans. 

441 


BONUS SUPPORT 

As an additional incentive to integration, the Title IV pro- 
gram might well be modified to provide substantially increased 
support upon attainment of specified levels of racial integra- 
tion. Such bonus assistance should be large enough to enable 
each recipient school to attain a clearly superior quality of 
education in comparison with non-integrated schools. 

EXEMPLARY SCHOOLS 

The Title IV program should stimulate development of ex- 
emplary city or metropolitan schools offering special courses 
and programs designed to attract, on a voluntary basis, students 
of varying racial and socio-economic backgrounds on a full 
or part-time basis.30 These model programs should make ex- 
tensive and imaginative use of resources uniquely available to 
city schools — the city itself, its museums, galleries, govern- 
mental institutions, and other public and private facilities. 

To the extent that the quality of city schools influences 
migration to the suburbs, development of exemplary schools 
could operate to retain middle-class white families in the city 
and induce others to return, so increasing opportunities for 
integration. Through educational planning on a metropolitan 
basis, fostered by direct federal grants to cooperative planning 
bodies encompassing city and suburban school districts, oppor- 
tunities for engaging central-city and suburban students in 
common educational experiences can be provided. 

Specific methods of providing integrated educational ex- 
periences under this program could include the following: 

• Establishment of major educational magnet schools: depending 
upon the size and racial character of the city and its suburbs, 
these schools could serve all the students of a small city, students 
living in different sections of a large city or subdivisions of a 
metropolitan area. Special curricula could include intensive in- 
struction or specialized educational programs (for example, sci- 
ence or commerce). 

• Establishment of supplemental education centers: these centers 
would offer specialized facilities and instruction to students from 
different schools for a portion of the school day. It is most im- 
portant that courses be developed and scheduled to provide 
racially integrated educational experiences. 

80 Limited funds have been provided for this purpose under Title III of the 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). This aspect of the Title III 
program could be used to supplement the Title IV program here proposed or 
could be discontinued, releasing limited ESEA funds for other purposes. 

442 


EDUCATIONAL PARKS 

Such a reoriented Title IV program could provide support, 
including construction funds, for communities choosing to 
develop the promising but costly educational parkas noW under 
consideration in several cities. 

As contrasted with the magnet schools and supplementary 
centers described above, educational parks would consolidate 
or cluster existing schools, thereby broadening attendance areas 
to bring within the school zone a racially and economically 
heterogenous population. These parks could be developed in 
conjunction with metropolitan plans to serve students from 
the suburbs, as well as the city. Their location should be se- 
lected to accomplish this objective. 

Because of the economies of size made possible through 
consolidation, the quality of education offered all of the stu- 
dents attending educational parks could be improved. Prob- 
lems raised by the size of such institutions could be overcome 
through inclusion of smaller sub-unit schools and individual- 
ized instruction made feasible by educational technology (com- 
puters, television) and savings resulting from the school con- 
solidation program. 

ELIMINATING DISCRIMINATION IN NORTHERN SCHOOLS 

While racial isolation in the urban public schools results 
largely from residential segregation, there is evidence that 
racial discrimination also plays a part in reducing opportunities 
for integration. 

For example, the Civil Rights Commission found that, when 
crowding in certain Cleveland and Milwaukee Negro schools 
became acute, school authorities began busing students to 
nearby underutilized white schools, where they were segre- 
gated in separate classrooms and luncheon facilities. When 
Negro residents objected, school officials in Milwaukee can- 
celed busing altogether as "educationally undesirable," even 
though white students had been bussed and integrated into 
receiving-school classrooms for years. In Cincinnati, to relieve 
overcrowding in a Negro school, students were bused past 
several nearby white schools with available space to a 98 
percent Negro school, 5.5 miles away. 

The Civil Rights Commission also reported that in many 
cities school attendance boundaries and location of new schools 
have been designed to perpetuate racial segregation. 

443 


TITLE VI 

Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Con- 
gress prohibited federal financial aid to any program or activ- 
ity which practices racial discrimination. 

Federal law requires that Title VI be applied uniformly in 
all states. Implementing this provision, the Department of 
Health, Education and Welfare has recently instituted a survey 
to examine compliance with Title VI in school districts of aU 
50 states. The Department has made clear that its investiga- 
tion is not directed at de facto segregation arising from reason- 
able application of neighborhood attendance policies. 

We support this survey and urge that it be followed by 
vigorous action to assure full compliance with federal law in 
all sections of the country. Sufficient staff and resources 
should be provided HEW, so that this program can be effective- 
ly carried out without reducing the Title VI effort in the 
South. 

•  PROVIDING QUALITY EDUCATION IN GHETTO SCHOOLS 

IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF TEACHING IN GHETTO SCHOOLS 

The teaching of disadvantaged children requires special 
skills and capabilities. Teachers possessing these qualifications 
are in short supply. We need a national effort to attract to 
the teaching profession well-qualified and highly motivated 
young people, and to equip them to work effectively with dis- 
advantaged students. 

The Teacher Corps program is a sound instrument for such 
an effort. Established by the Higher Education Act of 1965, 
it provides training in local colleges or universities for college 
graduates interested in teaching in poverty areas. Corpsmen 
are assigned to poverty area schools at the request of local 
school systems and with approval of state education agencies. 
They are employed by the school system and work in teams 
headed by experienced teachers. 

The National Advisory Council on the Education of Dis- 
advantaged Children and the National Education Association 
found the Teacher Corps to have succeeded in attracting 
dedicated young people to the teaching profession, training 
them to work effectively in poverty areas, and making sub- 
stantial contributions to the education of students. 

The impact of this highly promising program has been 
severely restricted by limited and late funding. There are now 
only 1,406 interns and 330 team leaders in the entire nation. 

444 


The Teacher Corps should be expanded into a major national 
program. 

The Education Professions Development Act ("EPDA") 
provides grants and fellowships to attract qualified persons 
to the field of education, and improve the ability of teachers 
through advanced training and retraining. The Act also pro- 
vides funds for institutes and workshops for other educational 
personnel, including guidance counselors, social workers, 
teacher aides and administrators. Finally, EPDA offers grants 
to local educational agencies experiencing critical shortages of 
teachers and teacher aides. 

We recommend that the EPDA program focus on the spe- 
cial need for expanding the supply and improving the quality 
of teachers working in schools serving disadvantaged students 
and that it be substantially funded. 

Concomitantly teacher training institutions should place 
major emphasis on preparing teachers for work in schools 
serving disadvantaged children. Courses should familiarize 
teacher candidates with the history, culture and learning prob- 
lems of minority group pupils. 

Class work alone, however, cannot be expected adequately 
to equip future teachers of disadvantaged children. Intensive 
in-service training programs designed to bring teacher can- 
didates into frequent and sustained contact with inner-city 
schools are required. Other professionals and non-professionals 
working in ghetto-related activities — social workers, street 
workers — could be included as instructors in teacher training 
programs. 

YEAR-ROUND EDUCATION FOR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS 

The present, anachronistic practice of releasing hundreds 
of thousands of children from a relatively full school schedule 
to idleness in the summer months is both a substantial factor 
in producing disorders and a tragic waste of time and facilities. 
Financing should be provided, through ESEA, for large-scale 
year-round programs in the disadvantaged areas of our cities. 
The testimony before this Commission, including that of Cabi- 
net members and public educators, was unanimous in its sup- 
port of this proposal. 

What is needed is not 12 months of the same routine, but 
innovative programs tailored to total educational needs, and 
providing a wide range of educational activities (verbal skills, 
culture and arts, recreation, job training, work experience and 
camps). 

Planning on a 12-month basis will be required. ESEA as- 
sistance should be provided through a single grant program 

445 


(rather than separate 10-month and summer grants) and con- 
ditioned on development of year-round educational plans. 
Technical assistance should be made available for such plan- 
ning. 

As a step toward year-round education, federal funds should 
be made available for school and camp programs this summer. 

The National Advisory Council on Education of Disad- 
vantaged Children studied summer programs set up with ESEA 
funds and found that they offer special opportunities for new 
approaches to teaching disadvantaged children. 

Summer camp programs offer significant educational and 
recreational opportunities, and should be encouraged. Educa- 
tional components, particularly verbal-skills projects, should 
be incorporated. It is essential that federal aid for such projects 
be committed well before the end of this school year, so that 
adequate time is available to design effective programs. 

EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION 

Early childhood education is the very heart of the effort 
to reconstruct the environment which incapacitates disad- 
vantaged children educationally, even before they enter the 
school system. Comprehensive preschool programs are essen- 
tial to overcome the early language deprivation and conceptual 
disabilities of these children. Yet no more than 40 percent 
of the eligible school population in most disadvantaged central- 
city areas is receiving even one year (age 4) of preschool 
training. 

We believe that the time has come to build on the success 
of the Head Start and other preschool programs in order to 
bring the benefits of comprehensive early childhood education 
to all children from disadvantaged homes, and to extend the 
reach to younger children. For this purpose, the Office of Eco- 
nomic Opportunity should receive substantially increased 
funds. 

Effective implementation of this expanded program will be 
vital to its success. We recommend the following guidelines: 

• Early childhood education programs should provide comprehen- 
sive educational support tailored to the needs of the child, and 
should not be simply custodial care. Both day care and Head Start 
components are part of comprehensive early childhood educa- 
tion; each should be designed to overcome the debilitating effect 
on learning ability of a disadvantaged environment. 

• Parents and the home environment have a critical impact on a 
child's early development. Early childhood programs should in- 
volve parents and the home, as well as the child. This can be 
accomplished through community education classes, and use of 

446 


community aides and mothers' assistants. To reduce the incidence 
of congenital abnormalities, these community-based programs 
should be tied in with prenatal training. 

• Since adequate facilities are scarce in many disadvantaged com- 
munities, where schools are overcrowded, and other buildings 
deteriorated, the program should provide funds for special early 
childhood education facilities. 

• There is a need for maximum experimentation and variety. Fund- 
ing should continue to support early childhood programs operated 
by community groups and organizations, as well as by the school 
system. 

• Early childhood education programs should include provisions 
for medical care and food, so that the educational experience can 
have its intended impact. 

IMPROVING EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES — ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS 

Without major changes in educational practices, greater 
expenditures on existing elementary schools serving disad- 
vantaged neighborhoods will not significantly improve the 
quality of education. Moreover, current assessments of pre- 
school programs indicate that their gains are lost in the ele- 
mentary grades, unless the schools themselves are improved. 

We suggest adoption of the following educational practices 
to improve school performance: 

• Extra incentives for highly qualified teachers working in ghetto 
and economically and culturally deprived rural area schools. 
The most effective means to attract such teachers is to make 
these schools exciting and attractive places to work. The recom- 
mended practices set forth below contribute toward this end. In 
addition, we suggest that opportunities for creative and imagina- 
tive teaching be expanded by allowing the teacher greater dis- 
cretion in selection and presentation of materials. Such an 
approach is likely to produce benefits in terms of attraction and 
retention of excellent teachers and improved student perform- 
ance. Rewards related to attainment of career objectives should 
be provided for teachers working in schools serving disadvan- 
taged children. For example, all school systems should consider 
requiring service in such schools as a condition to advancement 
to administrative positions, where the experience gained would 
be of great value. 

• Reduction in maximum class size: It is clear that disadvantaged 
students require more attention and exert greater demands on 
teacher time than middle-class students. While reduction of class 
size may not in itself improve pupil achievement, it will free 
teachers to devote more time to educating disadvantaged stu- 
dents. It is of vital importance, therefore, that efforts to reduce 
the maximum class size in schools serving disadvantaged students 
be coupled with programs designed to improve the skills and 
capacities of teachers of disadvantaged children. 

• Recognition of the history, culture and contribution of minority 
groups to American civilization in the textbooks and curricula of 

447 


all schools: In addition, school curricula should be adapted to 
take advantage of student experiences and interests in order to 
stimulate motivation. 

• Provision of supplementary services in the schools for severely 
disadvantaged or disturbed students: Such services should be 
made available within the schools, rather than at centralized 
facilities, and should include medical and psychiatric care. 

• Individualized instruction through extensive use of nonprofes- 
sional personnel: There is impressive evidence that these workers 
can make a meaningful educational contribution by providing 
individualized tutoring and incentive lacking in segregated schools. 

In the Homework Helper program in New York City, pupils 
in the fourth through sixth grades were tutored after school by 
senior high school students. Tutoring was provided four after- 
noons a week under the supervision of a master teacher; the tu- 
tors received training on the fifth day. Initiated with a grant from 
the Ford Foundation primarily to provide employment for high 
school students, the program had significant educational impact 
on both the pupils and the tutors. 

The Neighborhood Youth Corps and the College Work-Study 
programs provide the tools for reproducing this program in every 
major city. In some cities, NYC students are already working in 
these schools. But in many, NYC job assignments are far less 
stimulating. Colleges and universities should be encouraged to 
assign more students participating in the College Work-Study 
program to tutorial projects. 

Both programs, NYC and College Work-Study should be 
expanded and reoriented for this purpose. 

• Intensive concentration on basic verbal skills: A basic problem 
in schools in large cities is the low achievement in the funda- 
mental subjects of students from disadvantaged areas. This has 
been documented in the HARYOU Studies in New York, the 
study prepared for the McCone Commission following the Watts 
riot of 1965 and nationally in the Coleman Report. The lack of 
reading and writing ability affects detrimentally every other 
aspect of the later school program. Intensive assistance in literacy 
skills, including remedial assistance, should be provided in all 
schools serving disadvantaged children. 

We recognize that the enrichment programs we recommend 
will be very costly. ESEA provides financial assistance for 
such programs, but the amounts available do not match the 
need. To make a significant improvement in the quality of 
education provided in schools serving disadvantaged students, 
ESEA funding should be substantially increased from its cur- 
rent level. 

In addition, Title I should be modified to provide for greater 
concentration of aid for school districts having the greatest 
proportion of disadvantaged students. This can be accom- 
plished by altering the formula governing eligibility to exclude 
affluent school districts with less than specified minimum levels 
of poor students. 

448 


IMPROVING EDUCATIONAL  PRACTICES SECONDARY  SCHOOLS 

Many of the educational practices recommended with re- 
spect to the elementary schools are applicable at the secondary 
level. In addition, secondary school students require extensive 
guidance, counseling and advice in planning their education 
program and future careers. Such assistance, routinely provided 
by middle-class families, is lacking for the ghetto student. To 
promote its acceptance, indigenous personnel — college stu- 
dents, returning Vietnam veterans — should be utilized. 

The new Stay in School program, for which the President 
recently requested an appropriation of $30 million, could pro- 
vide funds for this and other projects designed to motivate 
disadvantaged high school students to pursue their education. 
We recommend that this program be fully funded. 

INTENSIVE NATIONAL PROGRAM TO INCREASE VERBAL 
SKILLS OF GHETTO RESIDENTS 

For the products of the ghetto schools, many of them unem- 
ployed and functionally illiterate, these efforts will come too 
late. To compensate for educational disadvantages already in- 
curred, we recommend a substantial appropriation to support 
an intensive year-round program beginning in the summer of 
1968 to improve the verbal skills of people in low-income 
areas, with primary emphasis on the language problems of 
minority groups. 

The present effort simply does not match the need. Current 
estimates indicate that there are approximately 16,300,000 
educationally disadvantaged Americans (those who have less 
than an 8th grade education). While exact figures are not 
available, it is highly likely that a disproportionate number of 
the educationally disadvantaged are Negroes. Census data es- 
tablishes that 36.9 percent of Negroes over 25 years of age, 
but only 14.8 percent of whites, are functionally illiterate. 

The principal federal literacy program — Adult Basic Edu- 
cation— is meeting only a small fraction of this need; as of 
June 1966, it had provided assistance to some 373,000 people. 

The Adult Basic Education program is a sound instrument 
for implementing an intensive literacy program. By affording 
both the public schools and community-based organizations 
the opportunity to conduct literacy projects, this program pro- 
vides desired flexibility. It should be strengthened and ex- 
panded to make a major impact on illiteracy. 

To concentrate its effect where the need is greatest and the 
potential payoff high, we suggest that priority be given to the 

449 


unemployed and underemployed, and to welfare mothers. In- 
creasing the literacy levels of these groups would eliminate a 
major barrier to productive employment, and improve sup- 
port for education in the home. 

The high school dropouts should be brought into the program 
by lowering the age limit from 18 to 16, as proposed by the 
President. Course offerings should be expanded to include 
matters of interest and concern to residents of low-income 
areas. 

EXPANDED EXPERIMENTATION,  EVALUATION,  AND RESEARCH 

Much remains to be learned about the most effective meth- 
ods of teaching disadvantaged children in schools segregated 
by race and class. Research efforts should be increasingly 
oriented in this direction. 

In addition to research, federal support should be provided 
for promising, but as yet unvalidated, experimental programs 
designed to involve the talents and resources of the entire com- 
munity in support of education of disadvantaged children, and 
develop new and better educational techniques particularly 
adapted to the interests and needs of these students. 

Among the educational approaches which we believe should 
be considered and evaluated are the current efforts to develop 
new patterns of education (such as storefront schools and 
street academies) for students who do not fit the traditional 
pattern, possible forms of competitive education (such as the 
use of businesses, universities and neighborhood corporations 
as subcontractors for the operation of certain education pro- 
grams), concentration of assistance to a few schools serving 
ghetto children in order to test the effects of a maximum com- 
pensatory education effort, development of model experimental 
subsystems (high school and several feeder schools to provide 
specialized instruction) and teaching English as a second 
language to ghetto students whose dialect often constitutes a 
first language. 

Finally, there is great need to evaluate not only these experi- 
mental programs but the entire enrichment effort. The Ele- 
mentary and Secondary Education Act should be amended to 
require recipient school systems to undertake a thorough evalu- 
ation of their compensatory education effort, as a condition to 
receiving ESEA funds. 

•  IMPROVING COMMUNITY-SCHOOL RELATIONS 

COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 
SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED 

The school systems of our largest cities have become highly 

450 


centralized, with decision-making responsibility for a large 
and disparate population concentrated in a central board of 
education. While this process has produced substantial bene- 
fits— city-wide tax base and nonpolitical administration — it has 
sometimes entailed serious sacrifices in terms of accountability 
and community participation. What is necessary is to preserve 
the worthwhile features present in the existing system while 
eliminating the liabilities thus far encountered. The objective 
must be to make public education more relevant and respon- 
sive to the community, and to increase support for it in the 
home. 

This can be accomplished through maintaining centralized 
control over educational standards and the raising of revenue, 
while decentralizing control over other aspects of educational 
policy. The precise mix must be determined locally. However, 
specific mechanisms for seeking the advice and consultation of 
students and parents such as Parents Advisory Councils or 
other similar bodies should be adopted. 

GHETTO SCHOOLS SHOULD SERVE AS COMMUNITY 
CENTERS 

School facilities should be available during and after normal 
school hours for a variety of community service functions, de- 
livery of social services by local agencies (including health and 
welfare), adult and community training and education pro- 
grams, community meetings, recreational and cultural acti- 
vities Decentralization and the establishment of Parents Ad- 
visory Councils will afford the community a means through 
which to communicate needs for such services and to play an 
active role in shaping activities. In addition to making better use 
of the major capital investment in school plants, this approach 
will encourage ghetto residents to regard their schools not as 
alien institutions but as vital community centers. 

USE OF LOCAL RESIDENTS AS TEACHER AIDES AND TUTORS 

We have noted the educational gains accomplished through 
use of local, subprofessional personnel in the schools. These 
workers can contribute to improving community-school rela- 
tions by providing a close link between the school system and 
the parents. 

RESULTS  OF  ACHIEVEMENT  AND  OTHER  TESTS  SHOULD  BE 
MADE PUBLIC ON A REGULAR BASIS 

To increase the accountability of the public schools, the 

451 


results of their performance should be made available to the 
public. Such information is available in some, but not all, cities. 
We see no reason for withholding useful and highly relevant 
indices of school (but not individual student) performance and 
recommend that all school systems adopt a policy of full public 
disclosure. 

•  EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGHER EDUCATION 

By enactment of the Higher Education Act of 1965, the Con- 
gress committed this nation to the goal of equal opportunity for 
higher education for all Americans, regardless of race or 
economic circumstance. While progress has been made, this 
goal, the key to virtually all managerial and professional jobs, 
remains for the disadvantaged student an unfulfilled promise. 

Mr. Harvey Oostdyck, Educational Director of the New York 
Urban League, testified that less than one percent of the youth 
in Harlem go to college. In the nation, approximately eight 
percent of disadvantaged high school graduates, many of whom 
are Negro, attend college; the comparable figure for all high 
school graduates is more than 50 percent. 

The fundamental reasons for this disparity lie in the cost of 
higher education and the poor quality of the elementary and 
secondary education available to minorities. In the preceding 
sections, we have recommended programs which we believe 
will ultimately eliminate these differences. But the full effect of 
these changes will not be felt for some years. In the interim, if 
we are to provide equality of opportunity for that segment of 
disadvantaged youth with college potential, special programs 
are needed. 

EXPANSION OF UPWARD BOUND AND ESTABLISHMENT OF 
SPECIAL ONE-YEAR POSTGRADUATE COLLEGE PREPARATORY 
SCHOOLS 

The Upward Bound program of the Office of Economic Op- 
portunity, under which students from poverty backgrounds 
attend intensive six to eight week summer sessions on college 
campuses and receive special assistance throughout the school 
year, is designed to motivate and prepare disadvantaged youth 
for college. The program has been effective. Of the 23,000 stu- 
dents covered in 1967 (52 percent of whom were Negro), 83 
percent went on to college. However, the size of the Upward 
Bound program is far short of the need. Estimates indicate 
that some 600,000 poverty-area students could usefully be 
included. 

452 


We believe that the Upward Bound concept is sound and 
recommend that the program be substantially expanded. 

Even an expanded Upward Bound program will not com- 
pensate for the poor level of secondary school education at- 
tained by ghetto youth. We recommend that federal funds be 
available for special one-year educational programs with the 
function of providing college preparatory training for disad- 
vantaged youth. These programs could be operated by com- 
munity colleges or local boards of education. 

REMOVING FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO HIGHER EDUCATION 

The effort to assist qualified but needy young people to obtain 
a higher education should be strengthened and expanded. 

Through the Educational Talent Search program, the Fed- 
eral Government provides financial assistance to public and 
nonprofit agencies to identify and encourage disadvantaged 
young people with college potential to enter or re-enter edu- 
cational programs. The President's proposed Educational Op- 
portunity Act of 1968 would provide combined grant, work 
and loan aid to poor college-bound students in need of financial 
assistance. Such assistance should be sufficiently flexible and 
substantial to accommodate the differing needs of individual 
students. 

These programs can make an important contribution to 
realization of the goal set by the President in his 1968 Edu- 
cation Message to the Congress "that every qualified young 
person . . . have all the education he wants and can absorb." 
If this promise is to become a reality, these programs must 
be funded at a level commensurate with need. 

The benefit gained by increasing opportunities for disad- 
vantaged students to seek and obtain higher education can be 
amplified by providing incentives for college-trained public 
service personnel (particularly, teachers and health workers) 
needed to work in poverty areas. This can be accomplished 
by providing for the cancellation of loans at a reasonable 
annual rate, if the recipient works in a low-income area. Such 
a forgiveness feature is included in the National Defense Edu- 
cation Act loan program. 

• EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 

Despite substantially increased efforts made possible by 
the Vocational Education Act of 1963, quality vocational 
education is still not available to all who need it. The recent 
report of the Advisory Council on Vocational Education, 

453 


established to evaluate the Act, concluded that, although five 
out of six youths never achieve a college education, only a 
quarter of the total high school population in the country re- 
ceived vocational education. Similarly, a 1964 Labor Depart- 
ment survey found that less than one-half of the non-college- 
trained labor force had any formal preparation for the jobs 
they held. 

Existing vocational training programs are not . effectively 
linked to job opportunities. The Advisory Council found "little 
evidence of much effort to develop programs in the area where 
critical manpower shortages exist" — examples are the health 
occupations and technical fields.31 

The special need of the dropout is still being neglected. 
With an unemployment rate for Negro youth more than twice 
that for white youth, this need is particularly acute. 

To improve the quality and expand the availability of voca- 
tional education, provision of additional funds as recom- 
mended by the Advisory Council may well be required. The 
federal vocational education program should be strengthened 
by enactment of the proposed Partnership for Learning and 
Earning Act of 1968. 

Significant improvement of vocational education, however, 
will depend on the use made locally of federal and other funds. 
We suggest the following guidelines: 

• Inclusion of intensive literacy training: literacy skills are obvi- 
ously indispensable to productive employment. All vocational 
education programs should provide literacy training, either 
directly or in conjunction with Adult Basic Education or other 
programs. 

• Greater emphasis on part-time cooperative education programs 
combining formal instruction and on-the-job training through 
use of release time: the Advisory Council found that these pro- 
grams, which provide students with jobs upon completion of the 
course, are the best available in the vocational education field. 
They consistently yield high placement records, high employment 
stability and high job satisfaction. The most important factor in 
improving vocational education is that training be linked to 
available jobs with upward mobility potential. To accomplish this 
goal, the active cooperation of the business community in defin- 
ing job needs and effective training practices should be fully 
engaged. Consideration should be given to releasing students to 
attend pretraining Opportunities Industrialization Centers. 

• Full implementation of vocational training programs for high 
school dropouts: the Advisory Council found that assistance 
available under the Vocational Education Act for the training 
of this group is not being adequately utilized. The need for doing 
so is critical. 

81 "Vocational Education: The Bridge Between Man and His Work," Report 
of the Advisory Council on Vocational Education, 1968, p. 29. 

454 


• Elimination of barriers to full participation of ghetto youth in 
vocational education programs: some vocational schools attempt 
to improve the quality of their student body and enhance their 
prestige by raising entrance requirements. This policy eliminates 
those in greatest need. This practice should be discontinued and 
support for these students expanded. 

• Follow-up support and assistance to ghetto youth receiving 
vocational training: the Advisory Council reported that "the 
most successful vocational programs are those which assume 
responsibility for placing their graduates and thus get feedback 
on their strengths and weaknesses."32 Vocational educators should 
continue to provide counselling and guidance for their students 
until they have been successfully placed in jobs related to their 
training. 

• Increased training to meet the critical need for more workers 
in professional, semi-professional and technical fields: demand 
for public service workers alone exceeds supply by five to one. 
Preparation of disadvantaged students for these desirable posi- 
tions should be greatly intensified. 

Implementation of These Programs 

The Federal Role — The principal burden for funding the 
programs we have proposed will fall upon the Federal Govern- 
ment. Caught between an inadequate and shrinking tax base 
and accelerating demands for public expenditures, the cities 
are not able to generate sufficient financing. Although there is 
much more that state governments can and should do, the 
taxing resources available at this level are far from adequate. 

The Federal Government has recognized and responded to 
this need. Federal expenditures for education, training and 
related services have increased from $4.7 billion in fiscal 1964 
to $12.3 billion in fiscal 1969. These figures include aid for 
preschool, elementary, secondary and higher education, voca- 
tional education, work-training and activities not related to 
the education of disadvantaged students. This network of 
federal educational programs provides a sound and compre- 
hensive basis for meeting the interrelated educational needs of 
disadvantaged students. We need now to strengthen that base, 
as we have proposed, and to build upon it by providing greatly 
increased federal funds for the education of the disadvantaged. 

The State Role — Many states provide more support for 
suburban and rural schools than for inner-city education sys- 
tems. Designed at a time when the suburban school systems 
were poorer than those in the cities, state aid formulas now 
operate to reinforce existing inequities. 

We urge that every state reexamine its present method of 
allocating funds to local school districts, not merely to pro- 
vide equal funds for all political subdivisions on a per-pupil 

*> Ibid., p. 62. 

455 


basis, but to assure more per-student aid to districts having a 
high proportion of disadvantaged students. Only if equalization 
formulas reflect the need to spend larger amounts per pupil in 
schools predominantly populated by disadvantaged students 
will state aid be allocated on an equitable basis. 

To assist the states in devising equalization formulas which 
would accomplish this objective, we recommend that the Office 
of Education develop prototype formulas. Federal programs 
should require allocation of federal aid to education within 
each state in accordance with formulas which conform with 
the criteria set forth above. 

We recognize that virtually all school districts need more 
money than they now receive. Provision of expanded state 
aid to education may well be justified. Whatever the amounts 
may be, we believe that allocation should be made in accord- 
ance with the standards described above. 

Finally, the states and, in particular, the state education 
agencies, have a key role to play in accomplishing school 
integration. The states are in a unique position to bring about 
urban-suburban cooperation and metropolitan planning. We 
urge that the efforts of state educational agencies in this area 
be given clear direction through adoption of state-wide, long- 
term integration plans and intensified through active pro- 
motion of such plans. 

The Local Role — We have emphasized that more money 
alone will not suffice. Accomplishment of the goal of mean- 
ingful educational opportunity for all will require exercise of 
enlightened and courageous leadership by local government. 
The programs which we have proposed can succeed only if 
imaginative and effective use is made locally of funds provided 
by Federal and State governments. Mayors, city councils, 
school boards and administrators must lead the community 
toward acceptance of policies which promote integration while 
improving the quality of education in existing, racially segre- 
gated schools. The cooperation of their suburban counterparts 
is no less essential. 

This responsibility is not limited to public officials. It is 
shared by the private community — business leaders, profes- 
sionals, clergymen, civic organizations. Attainment of the goal 
of equal and integrated educational opportunity will require 
the leadership, support, talents and energies of the entire com- 
munity.

III. The Welfare System 
Introduction 

The Commission believes that our present system of public 
assistance contributes materially to the tensions and social 
disorganization that have led to civil disorders. The failures 
of the system alienate the taxpayers who support it, the social 
workers who administer it, and the poor who depend on it. 
As one critic told the Commission, "The welfare system is de- 
signed to save money instead of people and tragically ends up 
doing neither." 

The system is deficient in two critical ways: 

First, it excludes large numbers of persons who are in great 
heed, and who, if provided a decent level of support, might 
be able to become more productive and self -sufficient; 

Second, for those who are included, it provides assistance 
well below the minimum necessary for a humane level of exist- 
ence, and imposes restrictions that encourage continued de- 
pendency on welfare and undermine self-respect. 

In short, while the system is indispensable simply because 
for millions — mostly children — it supports basic needs, drastic 
reforms are required if it is to help people free themselves from 
poverty. 

The existing welfare programs are a labyrinth of federal, 
state and local legislation. Over 90 percent of national welfare 
payments are made through programs that are partly or largely 
federally funded. These reach an average of 8 million per- 
sons each month: 

• 2.8 million are over 65, blind or otherwise severely handicapped. 

• 3.9 million are children in the Aid for Dependent Children 
(AFDC), whose parents do not or cannot provide financial 
support. 

• 1.3 million are the parents of children on AFDC. Of these, over 
one million are mothers and less than 200,000 are fathers; about 
two-thirds of the fathers are incapacitated. Only 60,000 fathers 
are in the special program called "Aid to Families with Depend- 
ent Children (Unemployed Parents)" (AFDC-UP) operating in 
22 states. 

Among all welfare programs, AFDC and AFDC-UP have 
clearly the greatest impact on youths and families in central 
cities areas; for this reason, they will be the principal focus for 
discussion here. 

States and local governments contribute an average of about 
45 percent of the cost of supporting the AFDC program, with 
each state setting the level of grants for its own residents. 

457 


Accordingly, monthly payments vary widely from state to state. 
They range from $9.30 per AFDC recipient monthly in Mis- 
sissippi to a high of $62.55 in New York. In fiscal year 1967, 
the total annual cost of the AFDC program, including federal, 
state and local contributions, was approximately $2.0 billion, 
providing an average of about $36 monthly for each recipient 
This sum is well below the poverty subsistence level under 
almost any standard. The National Advisory Council on Pub- 
lic Welfare has commented: 

"The national average provides little more than half the 
amounts admittedly required by a family for subsistence; in some 
low-income states, it is less than a quarter of that amount. The 
low public assistance payments contribute to the perpetuation 
of poverty and deprivation that extend into future generations," 

Over the last six years, despite the longest sustained period 
of economic progress in the history of this country, the AFDC 
caseload has risen each year while the unemployment rate 
has fallen. Cases increased nationally by 319,000 during fiscal 
year 1967 and will, under present HEW estimates, increase 
by another 686,000 during fiscal year 1968. The burden 
of welfare — and the burden. of the increases — will fall princi- 
pally on our central cities. In New York City alone, 525,000 
people receive AFDC support and 7,000 to 10,000 more are 
added each month. And it is estimated that in 1965, nation- 
wide, over 50 percent of persons eligible to receive assistance 
under welfare programs were not enrolled.33 

In addition to the AFDC program, almost all states have 
a program of general assistance to provide minimum pay- 
ments based largely or entirely on need. During calendar year 
1966, the states spent $336 million on general assistance. No 
federal funds have ever been available for this program. In 
fact, no federal funds have ever been available for the mil- 
lions of unemployed or underemployed men or women in the 
United States who are in need but are neither aged, severely 
handicapped nor the parents of minor children. 

The dimension of the "pool" of poor but unassisted indi- 
viduals and families — either ineligible under present programs 
or eligible but unenrolled — is indicated by the fact that in 
1966 there were 21.7 million nonaged persons in the United 
States with incomes below the "poverty level" as defined by 
the Social Security Administration. Only a third of these re- 
ceived assistance from major public welfare programs: 

88 Testimony before the Commission of Lisle C. Carter, Jr., Assistant Sec- 
retary for Individual and Family Services, Department of Health, Education 
and Welfare. 

458 


*'[T]he bulk of the nonaged poor live in families where there is 
a breadwinner who works either every day or who had worked 
a part of the year, so that the picture that people have of who 
the poor are is quite a different thing from an analysis of the 
poverty population. And what we have done in effect is carve 
out, because of our categorical approach to public assistance, a 
certain group of people within that overall poverty population 
to give help to. 

"Seventy per cent of the nonaged poor families were headed by 
men, and 50 per cent of these held full-time jobs and 86 per cent 
of them worked at least part of the year, so that the typical poor 
family is much like the typical American family, except they 
don't make enough money. And they have been historically 
excluded from the AFDC program."34 

The gaps in coverage and low levels of payments are the 
source of much of the long-term dissatisfaction with the system. 
The day-to-day administration of the system creates even 
sharper bitterness and dissatisfaction, because it repeatedly 
serves to remind recipients that they are considered untrust- 
worthy, ungrateful, promiscuous and lazy. Among the most 
troublesome statutory requirements, administrative practices 
and regulations are the following: 

First, in most states benefits are available only when a parent 
is absent from the home. Thus, in these states an unemployed 
father whose family needs public assistance in order to survive, 
must either abandon his family or see them go hungry. This 
so-called "Man-in-the-House" rule was intended to prevent 
payments to children who have an alternative potential source 
of support. In fact, the rule seems to have fostered the breakup 
of homes and perpetuated reliance on welfare. The irritation 
caused by the rule is aggravated in some states by regular 
searches of recipients' homes to ferret out violations. 
. Second, until recently all amounts earned by adult welfare 
recipients on outside jobs, except for small allowances for ex- 
penses, were deducted directly from the welfare payments they 
would otherwise have received. This practice, required by fed- 
eral law, appears to have taken away from many recipients the 
incentive to seek part- or full-time employment. The 1967 
amendments to the welfare laws permit retention of the first 
$30 earned by a recipient each month and one-third of all 
earnings above that amount. This is a start in the right direc- 
tion but does not go nearly far enough. New York City has, 
for example, begun experimenting with a promising program 
that allows welfare mothers to keep the first $85 of earnings 
each month and a percentage of amounts above that. 

Third, in most states, there is a residency requirement, gen- 
erally averaging around a year, before a person is eligible 

*lbld. 

459 


to receive welfare. These state regulations were enacted to 
discourage persons from moving from one state to another to 
take advantage of higher welfare payments. In fact, they ap- 
pear to have had little, if any, impact on migration and have 
frequently served to prevent those in greatest need — des- 
perately poor families arriving in a strange city — from receiv- 
ing the boost that might give them a fresh start. 

Fourth, though large amounts are being spent on social 
service programs for families, children and young people, few 
of these programs have been effective. In the view of the Ad- 
visory Council on Public Welfare, the inadequacies in social 
services: 

"are themselves a major source of such social evils as crime and 
juvenile delinquency, mental illness, illegitimacy, multi-genera- 
tional dependency, slum environments, and the widely deplored 
climate of unrest, alienation, and discouragement among many 
groups in the population." 

A final example of the system's inadequacy is the brittle 
relationship that exists between many welfare workers and the 
poor. The cumulative abrasive effects of the low levels of as- 
sistance, the complicated eligibility requirements, the con- 
tinuing efforts required by regulations to verify eligibility — 
often by means that constitute flagrant invasions of privacy — 
have often brought about an adversary relationship between 
the case worker and the recipient family. This is intensified 
by the fact that the investigative requirements not only force 
continuing confrontations but, in those states where the same 
worker performs both investigative and service functions, leave 
the worker little time to provide service. 

As was stated by Lisle Carter, Assistant Secretary of Health, 
Education and Welfare, in testimony before the Commission: 

"[W]e think [it] is extremely important that welfare recipients 
begin to feel that the welfare worker is on their side instead of 
on the side of the agency. There have been statements made 
that the welfare workers are among the most hated persons in 
the ghetto, and one of the studies shows that the recipients tend 
to feel that what the worker says is something that cannot be 
challenged. Nowhere do you get the feeling that . . . the worker 
is there to really go to bat for recipients in dealing with the other 
pressures that they face in the community. . . ." 

One manifestation of the tension and dissatisfaction created 
by the present system has been the growth of national and local 
welfare protest groups. Some are seeking to precipitate a na- 
tional welfare crisis, in part by bringing on the welfare rolls 
so many new recipients that America will be forced to face 
the enormity of its poverty problem. Others, often composed 
of welfare recipients or welfare workers, seek expanded wel- 

460 


fare programs and attack day-to-day inequities in the adminis- 
tration of the system. 

On the other hand, many Americans who advocate better 
housing, better schools, and better employment opportunities 
for disadvantaged citizens oppose welfare programs of all kinds 
in the belief that they subsidize people who should be work- 
ing. The fact is, as we have pointed out, that all but a small 
fraction of welfare recipients are disabled because of age, ill 
health or the need to care for their children. Even more basic 
is the fact that the heads of most poor families who can work 
are working, and are not on welfare. For both of these groups 
of people in need — those who cannot work and those who can 
and do — the problem in at least one vital respect is the same: 
lack of sufficient income to provide them with the kind of base 
on which they can begin building a path out of poverty, if 
not for themselves, at least for their children. 

An altered and expanded welfare system by extending sup- 
port to more of those in need, by raising levels of assistance on 
a uniform national basis, and by eliminating demeaning restric- 
tions, could begin to recapture the rich human resources that 
are being wasted by poverty. 

Basic Strategies 

In framing strategies to attack welfare problems, the Com- 
mission recognizes that a number of fundamental questions 
remain to be answered. Although many of the present inade- 
quacies in the system can be identified, and specific changes 
recommended, long-term measures for altering the system are 
still untested. 

A first strategy is to learn more about how welfare affects 
people and what its possibilities for creative use are. We en- 
dorse the recommendation of the Advisory Council on Public 
Welfare for greatly expanded research. We also commend the 
experimental incentive programs being carried out through the 
Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Office 
of Economic Opportunity, as well as the Model Cities Program 
through which some cities hope to develop integrated programs 
of income supplementation, job training and education. We 
further commend <he President's recent creation of a Com- 
mission on Income Maintenance Programs, which may pro- 
vide answers to the complex problems here presented. 

Despite the questions left open, we believe that many spe- 
cific inadequacies in the present structure can and should be 
corrected. 

• The most important basic strategy we would recommend is to 
overhaul the existing categorical system to: 

461 


(a) provide more adequate levels of assistance on the basis 
of uniform national standards. 

(b) reduce the burden on state and local government by 
financing the cost of assistance almost entirely with federal 
funds. 

(c) create new incentives to work and eliminate the features 
that cause hardship and dependency. 

(d) improve family-planning and other social services to 
welfare recipients. 

• Our longer-range strategy, one for which we can offer only tenta- 
tive guides, is the development of a national system of income 
supplementation to provide a basic floor of economic and social 
security for all Americans, 

Suggested Programs 

Overhauling the Present System 

To repair the defects in the existing categorical system is not 
simply a matter of changing one or two aspects. Major changes 
are needed in at least seven areas. 

• STANDARDS OF ASSISTANCE 

The federal government should develop a minimum income 
standard for individuals and families enrolled in AFDC. The 
standard for AFDC recipients should be at least as high as 
the subsistence "poverty" level periodically determined by the 
Social Security Administration. Only a few states now ap- 
proach this "poverty" level, which is currently set at $3,335 
for an urban family of four. The amending legislation should, 
if feasible, also permit cost of living variations among the 
states and within "high-cost" areas in each state. 

As a critical first step toward raising assistance levels, the 
Commission recommends that the present provision under 
which the federal government pays fifteen-eighteenths of the 
first $18 of AFDC monthly payments be amended to provide 
that the federal government assume the entire first $15 and 
the same proportion of payments beyond $15 presently applied 
to that above $18. Taken together with existing legislation that 
requires the states to maintain levels of support when federal 
assistance rates are increased, the effect of this change would 
be to raise by over one-third the monthly welfare payments in 
eight states of the Deep South. In Mississippi, payments would 
be more than doubled. 

• EXTENSION OF AFDC-UP 

The Commission strongly urges that the temporary legisla- 
tion, enacted in 1961, which extends the AFDC programs to 
include needy families with two unemployed parents be made

permanent and mandatory on all states and that the new fed- 
eral definition of "unemployment" be broadened. This pro- 
gram, which reaches the family while it is still intact, has been 
put into effect in only 22 states. Even in states where it has been 
implemented, the numbers participating have been small, partly 
because many states have narrowly defined the term "unem- 
ployment" and partly because the number of broken homes 
makes many children eligible under the regular form of AFDC. 

• FINANCING 

Because the states are unable to bear substantially increased 
welfare costs, the federal government should absorb a far 
greater share of the financial burden than presently. At least 
two methods are worth considering. The first would be to re- 
arrange payment formulas so that, even at the highest levels 
of payments, the federal government absorbed 90 percent or 
more of the costs. A second method would be to have the fed- 
eral government assume 100 percent of the increment in costs 
that would be encountered through raising standards of as- 
sistance and rendering AFDC-UP mandatory. Under either of 
these approaches, the share of costs presently imposed on mu- 
nicipal governments should be removed to release their lim- 
ited resources for other uses, 

• WORK INCENTIVES AND TRAINING 

In three important ways, steps were taken in the 1967 
amendments to the Federal Welfare Act to encourage — or 
compel — welfare recipients to seek employment. Each of these 
controversial steps had some salutory aspects but each requires 
substantial further attention: 

(a) Job training. The amendments provide substantially 
greater funds for job training. This was in principle a wise step. 
The amendments also, however, require the states to condition 
grants to "appropriate" adult welfare recipients on their will- 
ingness to submit to job training. Though the Commission 
agrees that welfare recipients should be encouraged to accept 
employment or job training, we strongly disagree with com- 
pelling mothers of small children to work or else lose welfare 
support. Many mothers, we believe, will want to work. A re- 
cent study of about 1,500 welfare mothers in New York in- 
dicated that 70 percent of all mothers — and 80 percent of 
Negro mothers — would prefer to work for pay than stay at 
home.35 

asPodell, Families on Welfare in New York City, Preliminary Report 
No. 3, "Mother's Education and Employment," p. 7 (1967). 

463 


(b) Day-care centers for children. The 1967 amendments 
provide funds for the first time for day-care programs for chil- 
dren of working mothers. Further expansion is desirable to 
make centers an effective means of enabling welfare recipients 
to take advantage of training and employment opportunities. 
Efforts should be made to ensure that centers are open in the 
evening and that more education features are built into center 
programs. State and federal standards that prevent centers 
from employing subprofessional workers, including welfare 
recipient mothers, should be removed. 

Welfare mothers themselves should be encouraged to set 
up cooperative centers with one or more mothers tending chil- 
dren of other mothers and with welfare funds available for 
salaries. Such "living room" day care can only be effective if 
the mother taking care of the children can be paid without 
losing any substantial portion of her welfare check. 

(c) Retention of part of earnings. The amendments permit 
an AFDC or AFDC-UP recipient to retain the first $30 of 
earned income monthly and one-third of the balance. Both 
the sums that can be kept without penalty, and the percentage 
of the balance, that can be retained, should be raised substan- 
tially to maximize incentive to work. Some experimental pro- 
grams are now going forward, but expanded efforts are needed 
to test different combinations and approaches. These programs 
should be supported at all levels of government. 

• REMOVAL OF FREEZE ON RECIPIENTS 

The 1967 welfare amendments freeze, for each state, the 
percentage of children who can be covered by federal AFDC 
grants to the percentage of coverage in that state in January 
1968. The anticipated effect of this new restriction will be to 
prevent federal assistance during 1968 to 475,000 new appli- 
cants otherwise eligible under present standards. In the face 
of this restriction, states and cities will have to dig further into 
already depleted local resources to maintain current levels. 
If they cannot bear the increased costs, a second alternative, 
less feasible under existing federal requirements, will be to 
tighten eligibility requirements for everyone or reduce per 
capita payments. We strongly believe that none of these al- 
ternatives are acceptable, and that the freeze should be elim- 
inated. 

• RESTRICTIONS ON ELIGIBILITY 

The so-called "Man-in-the-House" rule and restrictions on 
new residents of states should be eliminated. Though these 

464 


restrictions are currently being challenged in the courts, we 
believe that legislative and administrative action should be 
taken to eliminate them now. 

• OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM THAT SHOULD BE 
ALTERED OR STRENGTHENED 

(a) Clear and enforceable rights. These include prompt 
determinations of eligibility and rights to administrative ap- 
peal with representation by counsel. A recipient should be 
able to regard assistance as a right and not as an act of charity. 

Applicants should be able to establish initial eligibility by 
personal statements or affidavits relating to their financial situa- 
tion and family composition, subject to subsequent review 
conducted in a manner that protects their dignity, privacy and 
constitutional rights. Searches of welfare recipients' homes, 
whether with or without consent, should be abandoned. Such 
changes in procedures would not only accord welfare recipients 
the respect to which they are entitled but also release welfare 
workers to concentrate more of their time on providing service. 
They would also release a substantial portion of the funds 
spent on establishing eligibility for the more important func- 
tion of providing support. 

(b) Separation of administration of AFDC and welfare pro- 
grams for the disabled. The time that welfare workers have 
available for the provision of services would be increased 
further by separating the administration of AFDC and general 
assistance programs from aid to aged and physically incapaci- 
tated. The problems of these latter groups are greatly different 
and might better be handled, at the federal level, through the 
Social Security Administration. Any such change would, of 
course, require that programs for the disabled and aged con- 
tinue to be paid out of general funds and not impair the in- 
tegrity of the Social Security Trust Fund. 

(c) Special neighborhood welfare contact and diagnostic 
centers. Centers to provide the full complement of welfare 
services should be combined into the multi-purpose neighbor- 
hood service facilities being developed by the Office of Eco- 
nomic Opportunity and the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development. Federal funds should be provided to 
help local welfare agencies decentralize their programs through 
these centers, which would include representatives of all wel- 
fare, social, rehabilitation and income-assistance services. 

(d) Expansion of family-planning programs. Social work- 
ers have found that many women in poverty areas would like 
to limit the size of their families and are either unaware of 
existing birth control methods, or do not have such methods 

465 


available to them. Governments at all levels — and particularly 
the federal — should underwrite broader programs to provide 
family-planning information and devices to those who desire 
them. Through such programs, the Commission believes that 
a significant contribution can be made to breaking the cycle 
of poverty and dependency. 

Toward a National System of Income Supplementation 

In 1949, Senator Robert A. Taft described a system to pro- 
vide a decent level of income for all citizens: 

"I believe that the American people feel that with the high pro- 
duction of which we are now capable, there is enough left over 
to prevent extreme hardship and maintain a minimum standard 
floor under subsistence, education, medical care and housing, to 
give to all a minimum standard of decent living and to all chil- 
dren a fair opportunity to get a start in life." 

Such a "minimum standard of decent living" has been called 
for by many other groups and individuals, including the AFL- 
CIO, major corporate executives, and numerous civil rights 
and welfare organizations. The study of the new Commission 
on Income Maintenance Programs, and the Model Cities Pro- 
gram will be of particular importance in providing direction. 
We believe that efforts should be made to develop a system of 
income supplementation with two broad and basic purposes: 

• To provide for those who can work or who do work, any neces- 
sary supplements in such a way as to develop incentives for 
fuller employment; 

• To provide for those who cannot work and for mothers, who 
decide to remain with their children, a minimum standard of 
decent living, to prevent deprivation and aid in saving /children 
from the prison of poverty that has held their parents. 

Under this approach, then, all present restrictions on eligi- 
bility— other than need— would be eliminated. In this way, two 
large and important groups not covered by present federal pro- 
grams would be provided for: employed persons working at 
substandard hours or wages, and unemployed persons who are 
neither disabled nor parents of minor children. 

A broad system of supplementation would involve substan- 
tially greater federal expenditures than anything now contem- 
plated. The cost will range widely depending on the standard 
of need accepted as the "basic allowance" to individuals and 
families, and on the rate at which additional income above this 
level is taxed. Yet if the deepening cycle of poverty and de- 
pendence on welfare can be broken, if the children of the poor 
can be given the opportunity to scale the wall that now sepa- 

466 


rates them from the rest of society, the return on this invest- 
ment will be great indeed. 

IV. Housing 

Introduction 

The passage of the National Housing Act in 1934 signalled 
a new federal commitment to provide housing for the nation's 
citizens. Fifteen years later Congress made the commitment 
explicit in the Housing Act of 1949, establishing as a national 
goal, the realization of "a decent home and suitable environ- 
ment for every American family. " 

Today, after more than three decades of fragmented and 
grossly under-funded federal housing programs, decent hous- 
ing remains a chronic problem for the disadvantaged urban 
household. Fifty-six percent of the country's non-white families 
live in central cities today, and of these, nearly two-thirds live 
in neighborhoods marked by substandard36 housing and gen- 
eral urban blight. For these citizens, condemned by segrega- 
tion and poverty to live in the decaying slums of our central 
cities, the goal of a decent home and suitable environment is 
as far distant as ever. 

During the decade of the 1950's, when vast numbers of 
Negroes were migrating to the cities, only 4 million of the 
16.8 million new housing units constructed throughout the 
nation were built in the central cities. These additions were 
counterbalanced by the loss of 1.5 million central-city units 
through demolition and other means. The result was that the 
number of nonwhites living in substandard housing increased 
from 1.4 to 1.8 million, even though the number of substan- 
dard units declined. 

Statistics available for the period since 1960 indicate that the 
trend is continuing. There has been virtually no decline in the 
number of occupied dilapidated units in metropolitan areas, 
and surveys in New York City and Watts actually show an 
increase in the number of such units. These statistics have led 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development to con- 
clude that while the trend in the country as a whole is toward 
less substandard housing, "There are individual neighborhoods 
and areas within many cities where the housing situation con- 
tinues to deteriorate."37 

88 The Department of Housing and Urban Development classifies substandard 
housing as that housing reported by the United States Census Bureau as (1) 
sound but lacking full plumbing, (2) deteriorating and lacking full plumbing, 
or (3) dilapidated.

Committee on Government Operations, United States Senate, 89th Congress, 
2nd session, August 16, 1966, p. 148.

Inadequate housing is not limited to Negroes. Even in the 
central cities the problem affects two and a half times as many 
white as nonwhite households. Nationally, over 4 million of 
the nearly 6 million occupied substandard units in 1966 were 
occupied by whites. 

It is also true that Negro housing in large cities is signif- 
icantly better than that in most rural areas — especially in the 
South. Good quality housing has become available to Negro 
city dwellers at an increasing rate since the mid-1950's when 
the postwar housing shortage ended in most metropolitan 
areas. 

Nevertheless, in the Negro ghetto, grossly inadequate hous- 
ing continues to be a critical problem. 

Substandard, Old and Overcrowded Structures 

Nationwide, 25 percent of all nonwhites living in central 
cities occupied substandard units in 1960 compared to 8 per- 
cent of all whites. Preliminary Census Bureau data indicate 
that by 1966, the figures had dropped to 16 and 5 percent 
respectively. However, if "deteriorating" units and units with 
serious housing code violations are added, the percentage of 
nonwhites living in inadequate housing in 1966 becomes much 
greater. 

In 14 of the largest U.S. cities, the proportions of all non- 
white housing units classified as deteriorating, dilapidated, or 
lacking full plumbing in 1960 (the latest date for which figures 
are available), were as follows:

Conditions were far worse than these city-wide averages in 
many specific disadvantaged neighborhoods. For example, a 
study of housing in Newark, New Jersey, before the 1967 dis- 
orders, showed the following situation in certain predominantly 
Negro neighborhoods as of I960:38

These three areas contained 30 percent of the total population 
of Newark in 1960, and 62 percent of its nonwhite population. 
The Commission carried out special analyses of 1960 hous- 
ing conditions in three cities, concentrating on all Census 
Tracts with 1960 median incomes of under $3,000 for both 
families and individuals. It also analyzed housing conditions in 
Watts. The results showed that the vast majority of people 
living in the poorest areas of these cities were Negroes, and that 
a high proportion lived in inadequate housing:

Negroes, on the average, also occupy much older housing 
than whites. In each of ten metropolitan areas analyzed by the 
Commission, substantially higher percentages of nonwhites 
than whites occupied units built prior to 1939.

Finally, Negro housing units are far more likely to be over- 
crowded than those occupied by whites. In U.S. metropolitan 
areas in 1960, 25 percent of all nonwhite units were over- 
crowded by the standard measure (that is, they contained 1.01 
or more persons per room). Only 8 percent of all white-occu- 
pied units were in this category. Moreover, 11 percent of all 
nonwhite-occupied units were seriously overcrowded (1.51 or 
more persons per room), compared with 2 percent for white- 
occupied units. The figures were as follows in the ten metro- 
politan areas analyzed by the. Commission.

Higher Rents for Poorer Housing 

Negroes in large cities are often forced to pay the same 
rents as whites and receive less for their money, or pay higher 
rents for the same accommodations. 

The first type of discriminatory effect — paying the same 
amount but receiving less — is illustrated by data from the 1960 
Census for Chicago and Detroit.

In certain Chicago census tracts, both whites and nonwhites 
paid median rents of $88, and the proportions paying various 
specific rents below that median were almost identical. But 
the units rented by nonwhites were typically: 

• Smaller (the median number of rooms was 3.35 for nonwhites 
versus 3.95 for whites). 

• In worse condition (30.7 percent of all nonwhite units were 
deteriorated or dilapidated units versus 11.6 percent for whites). 

• Occupied by more people (the median household size was 3.53 
for nonwhites versus 2.88 for whites). 

• More likely to be overcrowded (27.4 percent of nonwhite units 
had 1.01 or more persons per room versus 7.9 percent for 
whites). 

In Detroit, whites paid a median rental of $77 as compared 
to $76 among nonwhites. Yet 27.0 percent of nonwhite units 
were deteriorating or dilapidated, as compared to only 10.3 
percent of all white units. 

The second type of discriminatory effect — paying more for 
similar housing — is illustrated by data from a study of housing 
conditions in disadvantaged neighborhoods in Newark, New 
Jersey. In four areas of that city (including the three areas 
cited previously), nonwhites with housing essentially similar 
to that of whites paid rents that were from 8.1 percent to 16.8 
percent higher. Though the typically larger size of nonwhite 
households, with consequent harder wear and tear, may par- 
tially justify the difference in rental, the study found that 
nonwhites were paying a definite "color tax" of apparently 
well over 10 percent on housing. This condition prevails in 
most racial ghettos. 

The combination of high rents and low incomes forces many 
Negroes to pay an excessively high proportion of their income 
for housing. This is shown by the following chart, showing the 
percentage of renter households paying over 35 percent of 
their incomes for rent in ten metropolitan areas:

The high proportion of income that must go for rent leaves 
less money in such households for other expenses. Undoubted- 
ly, this hardship is a major reason many Negro households 
regard housing as one of their worst problems. 

Discrimination in Housing Code Enforcement 

Thousands of landlords in disadvantaged neighborhoods 
openly violate building codes with impunity, thereby pro- 
viding a constant demonstration of flagrant discrimination by 
legal authorities. A high proportion of residential and other 
structures contain numerous violations of building and housing 
codes. Refusal to remedy these violations is a criminal offense, 
one which can have serious effects upon the victims living in 
these structures. Yet in most cities, few building code viola- 
tions in these areas are ever corrected, even when tenants com- 
plain directly to municipal building departments. 

There are economic reasons why these codes are not rigor- 
ously enforced. Bringing many old structures up to code stand- 
ards and maintaining them at that level often would require 
owners to raise rents far above the ability of local residents to 
pay. In New York City, rigorous code enforcement has already 
caused owners to board up and abandon over 2,500 buildings 
rather than incur the expense of repairing them. Nevertheless, 
open violation of codes is a constant source of distress to low 
income tenants and creates serious hazards to health and safety 
in disadvantaged neighborhoods. 

Housing Conditions and Disorder 

Housing conditions in the disorder cities surveyed by the 
Commission paralleled those for ghetto Negroes generally. 

Many homes were physically inadequate. Forty-seven per- 
cent of the units occupied by nonwhites in the disturbance 
areas were substandard. 

Overcrowding was common. In the metropolitan areas in 
which disorders occurred, 24 percent of all units occupied 
by nonwhites were overcrowded, against only 8.8 percent of 
the white-occupied units. 

Negroes paid higher percentages of their income for rent 
than whites. In both the disturbance areas and the greater 
metropolitan areas of which they were a part, the median 
rent as a proportion of median income was over 25 percent 
higher for nonwhites than for whites. 

The result has been widespread discontent with housing con- 
ditions and costs. In nearly every disorder city surveyed, griev- 

472 


ances related to housing were important factors in the struc- 
ture of Negro discontent 

Poverty and Housing Deterioration 

The reasons many Negroes live in decaying slums are not 
difficult to discover. First and foremost is poverty. Most ghetto 
residents cannot pay the rent necessary to support decent hous- 
ing. This prevents private builders from constructing new 
units in the ghettos or from rehabilitating old ones, for either 
action involves an investment that would require substantially 
higher rents than most ghetto dwellers can pay. It also deters 
landlords from maintaining units that are presently structurally 
sound. Maintenance too requires additional investment, and at 
the minimal rents that inner-city Negroes can pay, landlords 
have little incentive to provide it. 

The implications of widespread poor maintenance are seri- 
ous. Most of the gains in Negro housing have occurred through 
the turnover which occurs as part of the "filtering down" 
process — as the white middle class moves out, the units it 
leaves are occupied by Negroes. Many of these units are very 
old. Without proper maintenance, they soon become dilapi- 
dated, so that the improvement in housing resulting from the 
filtering-down process is only temporary. The 1965 New York 
City survey points up the danger. During the period that the 
number of substandard units was decreasing, the number of 
deteriorating units increased by 95,000. 

Discrimination 

The second major factor condemning vast numbers of Ne- 
groes to urban slums is racial discrimination in the housing 
market. Discrimination prevents access to many nonslum 
areas, particularly the suburbs, and has a detrimental effect 
on ghetto housing itself. By restricting the area open to a grow- 
ing population, housing discrimination makes it profitable for 
landlords to break up ghetto apartments for denser occupancy, 
hastening housing deterioration. Further, by creating a "back 
pressure" in the racial ghettos, discrimination keeps prices 
and rents of older, more deteriorated housing in the ghetto 
higher than they would be in a truly free and open market. 

Existing Programs 

To date, federal building programs have been able to do com- 
paratively little to provide housing for the disadvantaged. In 

473 


the 31 -year history of subsidized federal housing, only about 
800,000 units have been constructed, with recent production 
averaging about 50,000 units a year. By comparison, over a 
period only three years longer, FHA insurance guarantees 
have made possible the construction of over ten million middle 
and upper-income units. 

Federal programs also have done little to prevent the growth 
of racially segregated suburbs around our cities. Until 1949, 
FHA official policy was to refuse to insure any unsegregated 
housing. It was not until the issuance of Executive Order 1 1063 
in 1962 that the Agency required nondiscrimination pledges 
from loan applicants. 

It is only within the last few years that a range of programs 
has been created that appears to have the potential for sub- 
stantially relieving the urban housing problem. Direct federal 
expenditures for housing and community development have 
increased from $600 million in fiscal 1964 to nearly $3 billion 
in fiscal 1969. To produce significant results, however, these 
programs must be employed on a much larger scale than they 
have been so far. In some cases the constraints and limitations 
imposed upon the programs must be reduced. In a few in- 
stances supplementary programs should be created. In all cases, 
incentives must be provided to induce maximum participation 
by private enterprise in supplying energy, imagination, capital 
and production capabilities. 

Federal housing programs must also be given a new thrust 
aimed at overcoming the prevailing patterns of racial segrega- 
tion. If this is not done, those programs will continue to con- 
centrate the most impoverished and dependent segments of the 
population into the central-city ghettos where there is already 
a critical gap between the needs of the population and the 
public resources to deal with them. This can only continue to 
compound the conditions of failure and hopelessness which 
lead to crime, civil disorder and social disorganization. 

Basic Strategies 

We believe the following basic strategies should be adopted: 

• The supply of housing suitable for low-income families should 
be expanded on a massive basis. 

The basic reason many Negroes are compelled to live in 
inadequate housing is the failure of the private market to 
produce decent housing at rentals they can afford to pay. Pro- 
grams we have recommended elsewhere are directed toward 
raising income levels. Yet it is obvious that in the foreseeable 

474 


future there will continue to be a gap between the income of 
many Americans and the price of decent housing produced 
by normal market mechanisms. Thus, the implementation of 
the strategy depends on programs which not only generate 
more lower cost housing, but also raise the rent-paying capa- 
bility of low-income households. 

• Areas outside of ghetto neighborhoods should be opened up to 
occupancy by racial minorities. 

Provision of decent low-cost housing will solve only part of 
the problem. Equally fundamental is the elimination of the 
racial barrier in housing. Residential segregation prevents 
equal access to employment opportunities and obstructs efforts 
to achieve integrated education. A single society cannot be 
achieved as long as this cornerstone of segregation stands. 

Suggested Programs 

We propose programs in ten areas to illustrate how we be- 
lieve the basic strategies we have outlined can be put into 
effect: 

• Provision of 600,000 low- and moderate-income housing units 
next year, and 6 million units over the next five years. 

• An expanded and modified below-market interest rate program. 

• An expanded and modified rent supplement program, and an 
ownership supplement program. 

• Federal write-down of interest rates on loans to private builders. 

• An expanded and more diversified public housing program. 

• An expanded Model Cities Program. 

• A reoriented and expanded urban renewal program. 

• Reform of obsolete building codes. 

• Enactment of a national, comprehensive and enforceable open- 
occupancy law. 

• Reorientation of federal housing programs to place more low- 
and moderate-income housing outside of ghetto areas. 

The Supply of Housing Suitable for Low-Income Families 
Should Be Expanded 

The Commission Recommends 

• PROVISION OF 600,000 LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME HOUS- 
ING UNITS NEXT YEAR, AND 6 MILLION UNITS OVER THE NEXT 
FIVE YEARS 

Some 6 million substandard housing units are occupied in 
the United States today, and well over that number of families 
lack sufficient income to rent or buy standard housing, with- 
out spending over 25 percent of their income and thus sacri- 
ficing other essential needs. The problem promises to become 

475 


more critical with the expanded rate of family formation on 
the immediate horizon and the increasing need to replace 
housing which has been destroyed or condemned. 

In our view, the dimension of the need calls for an unprece- 
dented national effort. We believe that the nation's housing 
programs must be expanded to bring within the reach of low- 
and moderate-income families 600,000 new and existing units 
next year, and 6 million units over the next five years. 

This proposal can only be implemented if present subsidy 
programs are extended so that (a) a part of the existing hous- 
ing inventory can be brought within the reach of lower income 
families, and (b) private enterprise can become a major factor 
in the low-cost housing field, both in terms of the construction 
capabilities of private developers and the capital of private 
institutional lenders. 

In the sections that follow, we discuss specific programs that 
must be part of this expanded national effort. 

• AN EXPANDED AND MODIFIED BELOW-MARKET INTEREST RATE 
PROGRAM 

The below-market interest rate program, which makes long- 
term, low-interest financing available to nonprofit and limited 
profit sponsors, is the best mechanism presently available for 
engaging private enterprise in the task of providing moderate 
and lower-income housing. 

Several limitations, however, prevent the program from 
providing the quantity of housing that is needed. Nonprofit 
sponsors are deterred by lack of seed money to finance pre- 
construction costs, limited profit corporations are deterred by 
the statutory prohibition on transfer or refinancing of projects 
for 20 years without FHA permission. Funding levels are 
inadequate to launch a national program. 

We recommend that legislation be enacted to permit inter- 
est-free loans to nonprofit sponsors to cover preconstruction 
costs, and to allow limited profit corporations to sell projects 
to nonprofit corporations, cooperatives, or condominiums. We 
also recommend that funding levels of the program be sub- 
stantially increased. 

Though the potential of the program is great, it presently 
serves few truly low-income families. Current costs average 
$14,400 per unit, making the typical rental for a two-bedroom 
unit $110 per month, thereby in effect requiring a minimum 
annual income of $5,300. Only with rent supplements can poor 
families afford housing commanding rents of this amount, but 
the amount of rent supplement funds which can be used in such 

476 


developments is limited by statute to 5 percent of the total 
appropriation for the rent supplement program. 

In order to make below-market interest rate housing avail- 
able to low as well as moderate-income families, we recom- 
mend that the 5 percent limitation be removed, and that the 
overall funding of rent supplements be greatly expanded. We 
also recommend that serious consideration be given to expand- 
ing the interest subsidy under the program in order to lower 
the rate for sponsors. 

• AN EXPANDED AND MODIFIED RENT SUPPLEMENT PROGRAM, 
AND AN OWNERSHIP  SUPPLEMENT PROGRAM 

The rent supplement program offers a highly flexible tool 
for subsidizing housing costs, because it permits adjustment 
of the subsidy according to the income of the tenant. The 
project financing is at market rates, so that tenants who do not 
qualify for supplements must pay market rentals. Potentially, 
therefore, these developments can provide an alternative to 
public housing for low-income families, while still attracting 
middle-income families. 

We believe, however, that several changes are necessary if 
the full potential of this program is to be realized. 

First, we recommend that existing regulations restricting 
architectural design, imposing rigid unit cost standards, and 
limiting tenant income to amounts lower than required by 
statute be removed. These regulations diminish the attractive- 
ness of the program to private developers, and represent a 
major barrier to substantial expansion of the program. 

Second, the statutory limitation of rent supplements to new 
or rehabilitated housing should be changed to permit use of 
rent supplements in existing housing. In many areas, removal 
of the restriction would make possible a major increase of the 
program without requiring investment in new construction. 
This option must be made available if the program is to be 
expanded to its fullest potential. 

Third, the rent supplement concept should be extended to 
provide home ownership opportunities for low-income fami- 
lies. The ambition to own one's own home is shared by virtually 
all Americans, and we believe it is in the interest of the nation 
to permit all who share such a goal to realize it. Home owner- 
ship would eliminate one of the most persistent problems 
facing low-income families in rental housing — poor main- 
tenance by absentee landlords — and would provide many low- 
income families with a tangible stake in society for the first 
time. 

The Senate Banking and Currency Committee recently ap- 

477 


proved a bill that would establish a program to pay a portion 
of the mortgage payments of low-income families seeking to 
purchase homes. As with rent supplements, subsidy payments 
would decrease as the purchasers income rose. The income 
limits of the program — 70 percent of the below-market inter- 
est rate eligibility limits — would, in our opinion, greatly impair 
its usefulness and should be eliminated. With that reservation, 
we strongly endorse the concept, urge that such a program of 
ownership supplements be enacted, and recommend that it be 
funded on a basis that will permit its wide use in achieving 
the goal of 6 million units for low- and moderate-income fami- 
lies over the next five years. 

• FEDERAL  WRITE-DOWN  OF  INTEREST  RATES  ON  LOANS  TO 
PRIVATE BUILDERS 

To make private loan capital available, we recommend di- 
rect federal write-down of interest rates on market rate loans 
to private construction firms for moderate-rent housing. This 
program would make it possible for any qualified builder to 
enter the moderate-rent housing field on the basis of market 
rate financing, provided that the project meets necessary cri- 
teria. The federal government would enter into a contract with 
the financing institution to supply the difference between the 
mortgage payment at the market interest rate and 20 percent 
of the tenant's monthly income, to a specified maximum "write- 
down" which would make the interest rate paid by the tenant 
equivalent to 1 or 2 percent. 

• AN EXPANDED AND MORE DIVERSIFIED PUBLIC HOUSING PRO- 
GRAM 

Since its establishment in 1937, the public housing program 
has produced only some 650,000 low-rent housing units. In- 
sufficient funding has prevented construction of a quantity 
more suited to the need, and unrealistic unit-cost limitations 
have mandated that most projects be of institutional design 
and mammoth size. The resulting large concentration of low- 
income families has often created conditions generating great 
resistance in communities to new projects of this type. 

We believe that there is a need for substantially more public 
housing, but we believe that the emphasis of the program 
should be changed from the traditional publicly-built, slum- 
based, high-rise project to smaller units on scattered sites. 
Where traditional high-rise projects are constructed, facilities 
for social services should be included in the design, and a 
broad range of such services provided for tenants. 

478 


To achieve the shift in emphasis we have recommended, we 
urge first, expansion of present programs under which public 
housing authorities lease existing scattered site units. Present 
statutory restrictions on long-term leasing should be eliminated 
to provide incentives for private construction and financing. 
Families whose incomes increase above the public housing 
limit should be permitted to take over the leases of their units 
from the housing authority. 

We also urge expansion of present "turnkey" programs, un- 
der which housing authorities purchase low-rent units con- 
structed by private builders instead of constructing the units 
themselves. Here too, families whose incomes rise above the 
public housing limits should be permitted to stay in the units 
at market rentals. 

• AN EXPANDED MODEL CITIES PROGRAM 

The Model Cities Program is potentially the most effective 
weapon in the federal arsenal for a long-term, comprehensive 
attack on the problems of American cities. It offers a unique 
means of developing local priorities, coordinating all applicable 
government programs — including those relating to social de- 
velopment (e.g., education and health) as well as physical 
development — and encouraging innovative plans and tech- 
niques. Its "block grant" multi-purpose funding feature allows 
the city to deploy program funds with much greater flexibility 
than is possible under typical categorical grant programs. The 
statutory requirement that there be widespread citizen partici- 
pation and maximum employment of area residents in all 
phases of the program promises to involve community residents 
in a way we think most important. 

The full potential of the program can be achieved, how- 
ever, only if (a) the Model Cities Program is funded at a level 
which gives the cities involved an opportunity and incentive 
to produce significant results, and (b) the various programs 
which can be brought into play under Model Cities, such as 
urban renewal, below-market interest rate housing, and health, 
education and welfare programs, are independently supported 
at levels which permit Model Cities' funds to be used for essen- 
tially innovative purposes. Appropriations must also be suffi- 
cient to expand coverage far beyond the 63 cities that are 
currently funded. 

The President has recommended that $1 billion be appro- 
priated for Model Cities. We strongly support this recom- 
mendation as a minimum start, noting that a much greater 
scale of funding will ultimately be necessary if the program 

479 


proves successful and if it is to be made available to all the 
cities that require such aid. 

• A REORIENTED AND EXPANDED URBAN RENEWAL PROGRAM 

Urban renewal has been an extremely controversial program 
since its inception. We recognize that in many cities it has 
demolished more housing than it has erected, and that it has 
often caused dislocation among disadvantaged groups. 

Nevertheless, we believe that a greatly expanded, though re- 
oriented, urban renewal program is necessary to the health of 
our cities. Urban renewal is an essential component of the 
Model Cities Program and, in its own right, is an essential 
tool for any city attempting to preserve social and economic 
vitality. 

Substantially increased funding will be necessary if urban 
renewal is to become a reality in all the cities in which renewal 
is needed. A reorienting of the program is necessary to 
avoid past deficiencies. The Department of Housing and Urban 
Development has recognized this, and has promulgated policies 
giving top priority to urban renewal projects that directly assist 
low-income households in obtaining adequate housing. Projects 
aimed primarily at bolstering the economic strength of down- 
town areas, or at creating housing for upper-income groups 
while reducing the supply of low-cost housing, will have low 
priority, unless they are part of balanced programs including 
a strong focus on needs of low-income groups. It is with these 
priorities in mind that we recommend substantial expansion 
of the program. 

• REFORM OF OBSOLETE BUILDING CODES 

\ 

Approximately 5,000 separate jurisdictions in the United 
States have building codes. Many of these local codes are 
antiquated and contain obsolete requirements that prevent 
builders from taking advantage of new technology. Beyond 
the factor of obsolesence, the very variety of the requirements 
prevents the mass production and standardized design that 
could significantly lower building costs. 

Opinions differ as to whether a uniform national code is yet 
feasible, but it is clear that much greater uniformity is pos- 
sible than presently exists. We urge state and local govern- 
ments to undertake the task of modernizing their codes at 
once, and recommend that the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development design, for their guidance, a model na- 
tional code. We can no longer afford the waste caused by 
arbitrary and archaic building codes. 

480 


Areas Outside of Ghetto Neighborhoods Should Be Opened 
Up to Occupancy by Racial Minorities 

The Commission Recommends 

• ENACTMENT OF A NATIONAL, COMPREHENSIVE AND ENFORCE- 
ABLE OPEN-OCCUPANCY LAW 

The federal government should enact a comprehensive and 
enforceable open-occupancy law making it an offense to dis- 
criminate in the sale or rental of any housing — including 
single family homes — on the basis of race, creed, color, or 
national origin. 

In recent years, various piecemeal attempts have been made 
to deal with the problem of housing discrimination. Executive 
Order 11063, issued by President Kennedy in 1962, provided 
that agreements for federally assisted housing made after the 
date of the Order must be covered by enforceable nondis- 
crimination pledges. Congress, in enacting Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, promulgated a broad national policy of 
nondiscrimination with respect to programs or activities receiv- 
ing federal financial assistance — including public housing and 
urban renewal. Eighteen states and more than 40 cities have 
enacted fair housing laws of varying degrees of effectiveness. 

Despite these actions, the great bulk of housing produced 
by the private sector remains unaffected by anti-discrimination 
measures. So long as this continues, public and private action 
at the local level will be inhibited by the argument that local 
action produces competitive disadvantage. 

We have canvassed the various alternatives, and have come 
to the firm opinion that there is no substitute for enactment 
of a federal fair housing law. The key to breaking down hous- 
ing discrimination is universal and uniform coverage, and such 
coverage is obtainable only through federal legislation. 

We urge that such a statute be enacted at the earliest pos- 
sible date. 

Open housing legislation must be translated into open hous- 
ing action. Real estate boards should work with fair housing 
groups in communities where such groups exist, and help form 
them in areas where they do not exist. The objective of vol- 
untary community action should be (1) the full dissemination 
of information concerning available housing to minority 
groups, and (2) providing information to the community con- 
cerning the desirability of open housing. 

• REORIENTATION OF FEDERAL HOUSING PROGRAMS TO PLACE 
MORE LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME HOUSING OUTSIDE OF 
GHETTO AREAS 

481 


Enactment of a national fair housing law will eliminate the 
most obvious barrier limiting the areas in which nonwhites 
live, but it will not deal with an equally impenetrable barrier, 
the unavailability of low and moderate income housing in 
nonghetto areas. 

To date, housing programs serving low-income groups have 
been concentrated in the ghettos. Nonghetto areas, particularly 
suburbs, for the most part have steadfastly opposed low-in- 
come, rent supplement, or below-market interest rate housing, 
and have successfully restricted use of these programs outside 
the ghetto. 

We believe that federally aided low- and moderate-income 
housing programs must be reoriented so that the major thrust 
is in nonghetto areas. Public housing programs should em- 
phasize scattered site construction, rent supplements should, 
wherever possible, be used in nonghetto areas, and an intensive 
effort should be made to recruit below-market interest rate 
sponsors willing to build outside the ghettos. 

The reorientation of these programs is particularly critical 
in light of our recommendation that 6 million low and middle- 
income housing units be made available over the next five 
years. If the effort is not to be counter-productive, its main 
thrust must be in nonghetto areas, particularly those outside 
the central city.

Conclusion 

One of the first witnesses to be invited to appear before this 
Commission was Dr. Kenneth B. Clark, a distinguished and 
perceptive scholar. Referring to the reports of earlier riot com- 
missions, he said: 

I read that report ... of the 1919 riot in Chicago, and it is as if 
I were reading the report of the investigating committee on the 
Harlem riot of '35, the report of the investigating committee on 
the Harlem riot of '43, the report of the McCone Commission 
on the Watts riot. 

I must again in candor say to you members of this Commission 
— it is a kind of Alice in Wonderland — with the same moving 
picture re-shown over and over again, the same analysis, the 
same recommendations, and the same inaction. 

These words come to our minds as we conclude this Report 
We have provided an honest beginning. We have learned 
much. But we have uncovered no startling truths, no unique 
insights, no simple solutions. The destruction and the bitterness 
of racial disorder, the harsh polemics of black revolt and white 
repression have been seen and heard before in this country. 
It is time now to end the destruction and the violence, not 
only in the streets of the ghetto but in the lives of people.

PART IV 
SUPPLEMENT AND APPENDICES 


Supplement on Control of Disorder 

Introduction 

In this Supplement we focus principally on controlling dis- 
orders that have escalated beyond immediate police capabilities 
and require a total community response to halt the violence. We 
also consider the rarer cases where state or federal forces are 
necessary to achieve control. 

Within this context, we assess the present capabilities and 
preparedness of public safety forces, military units, civil govern- 
ment, and the community at large, and make recommendations 
to help assure adequate responses at all levels. 

I. The Police and Control of Civil Disorders 

The capability of a police department to control a civil dis- 
order depends essentially on two factors: proper planning and 
competent performance. These rely in turn upon the quantity 
and quality of police manpower, the training of patrolmen and 
police commanders, and the effectiveness of their equipment. 

This portion of the Supplement will review the adequacy of 
police planning, training and equipment to deal with civil dis- 
orders, together with the Commission's recommendations for 
improvement. 

When underlying tensions are present — and they exist in every 
American city with a large minority population — a small incident 
can turn a crowd into a mob. Last summer an appreciable num- 
ber of incidents were triggered by police actions — some serious, 
such as shooting a suspect, but usually by routine activities, such 
as a simple arrest. 

The way policemen approach an incident often determines 
whether it is contained or develops into a serious disorder. Expe- 
rienced police administrators consulted by the Commission re- 
peatedly stressed the need for good judgment and common sense 
among police officers called to the scene of an incident in a 
neighborhood where tensions exist. They warned against using 
sirens and flasher lights that attract crowds. They cautioned 
against over-responding to a small incident with too much vis- 
ible force — riot guns and helmets may only aggravate a tense 
situation. Yet they also pointed out that control has sometimes 
been lost because an insufficient number of police were on hand 
to control a disorder in its initial stages. A major lesson of the 

484 


1967 disorders was that it takes a seasoned senior officer to make 
the all -important initial assessments and decisions that will con- 
tain an incident. 

If an incident develops, and a crowd begins to threaten law- 
lessness and acts of violence, the police must act promptly and 
with a sufficient display of force to make clear their intent and 
capacity to suppress disorder and ensure the public safety. 

Planning 

Effective preparation for disorder requires catref ul plans. Large 
numbers of police officers must be mobilized, deployed, and di- 
rected by senior officers. They must have adequate logistical 
support, particularly if extended operations are necessary. 

Mobilization Planning — To find and mobilize enough police- 
men to handle a riot emergency is difficult, even in large cities. 
In one major city with a population of more than 1 million, an 
area of 140 square miles, and a police force of nearly 5,000 men, 
no more than 192 patrolmen were on duty when a major civil dis- 
order erupted. Of these, only 44 were in the riot area. The diffi- 
culties in mobilizing additional men were described by the police 
commissioner: 

It cannot be emphasized too strongly that mobilization 
is inherently a time consuming operation, no matter how 
efficient. After a man is notified, he must dress and 
travel to his reporting point. Once he has checked in and 
has been equipped, he must be turned around and trans- 
ported to a command post or an assembly point. There 
he must be briefed on the situation that exists, the loca- 
tion of the riot area, his duties, and other details re- 
quired to make him effective once he is deployed. He 
must then be actually committed to the area of involve- 
ment. The time lapse in this entire procedure ranges 
from 1M$ to 2 hours. 

By the time sufficient manpower was brought in, the disorder 
had developed beyond the control capability of the police depart- 
ment. 

Adding to this difficulty is the fact that the standard training 
for police operations is basically different from that required 
for riot control. Traditional police training seeks to develop offi- 
cers who can work independently and with little direct super- 
vision. But the control of civil disturbances requires quite dif- 
ferent performance — large numbers of disciplined personnel, 
comparable to soldiers in a military unit, organized and trained 
to work as members of a team under a highly unified command 
control system. No matter how well-trained and skilled a police 
officer may be, he will be relatively ineffectual to deal with civil 
disturbances so long as he functions as an individual. Thus, a 
major civil disturbance requires a police department to convert 
itself, suddenly, into a different organization with new opera- 
tional procedures. 

To cope with the difficulties of this transition, a police depart- 
ment needs a plan that can mobilize and deploy needed man- 
power with a minimum deviation from established operating 

485 


procedures, and with minimum curtailment of essential police 
services 

A study conducted for the Commission by the International 
Association of Chiefs of Police of 30 major police departments 
found that all had some form of written mobilization plan. The 
quality of the plans varied greatly. Principal defects were 
procedures for implementing the plan; provision for relief of 
reserve forces after the plan has been activated; accounting for 
personnel dispatched to a disorder; predesignated assembly area* 
or command posts in the various areas of the cities where trouble 
might be expected; logistical support of police and other law 
enforcement officers engaged in control activities; flexibility in 
planning to cope with disorders of varying natures and magni- 
tudes; and unnecessarily complicated planning that deviated ex- 
cessively from normal operations. 

Because of these deficiencies in the mobilization plans of the 
leading police departments, and in response to many requests 
for assistance, the Commission has prepared a model plan, 
which can be adapted to local requirements. Currently used 
as training material in the Conferences on the Prevention 
and Control of Civil Disorders sponsored by the Department of 
Justice in response to Commission recommendations, the plan 
will be revised as additional information is developed by these 
conferences. The Commission recommends that the Department 
of Justice disseminate the revised plan to police departments 
across the country and make it available in federally-sponsored 
training on riot control methods. 

Operational Planning— Operational planning is a necessary 
complement to mobilization planning. It provides guidance to 
the police command and the men of the steps necessary to 
control the disorder. It includes command and control mecha- 
nisms, communication, intelligence, means to combat inflamma- 
tory rumors, and tactics. 

(1) Command and Control and Communications — Whether 
the shift from normal routine police operations to an emergency 
basis is smooth and effective depends upon the speed with 
which the police can provide unified command and control. Un- 
der ordinary conditions, a police dispatcher controls the move- 
ment of men and equipment from a central position to places 
where they are needed. In most police departments the system 
works well enough so long as the demands on the dispatcher 
are within the capabilities of the man and his equipment. 

Many local police departments called upon to control civil dis- 
orders have had serious problems in commanding and controlling 
the large numbers of men required to work together as an effec- 
tive, coordinated team. The problem has been compounded by 
the shortage of on-duty supervisors and staff at certain periods 
of the day. It is one thing to assemble a large force; it is quite 
another to provide appropriate direction and leadership. 

Effective command and control in a civil disorder depends 
upon communications, and communications is a function both 
of planning and of equipment. Relatively few police departments 
have adequate communications equipment or frequencies. Forty- 
two percent of all police departments studied by the Commission 
had no special radio frequency for emergencies. 

The lack of emergency frequencies overloads normal f requen- 

486 


ties. This may not only preclude effective command and control 
of police in the area of a civil disorder but may also undermine 
the ability of the police to provide vital services to the remainder 
of the city. 

The absence of adequate communication facilities is particu- 
larly acute with respect to outside police assistance. Approxi- 
mately 50 percent of all police agencies surveyed had inadequate 
means to coordinate with neighboring jurisdictions. Incompatible 
radio frequencies were found to have handicapped the effective 
use of neighboring police departments. When local and state 
police must cooperate with National Guard units, the need for 
communications coordination is urgent. 

We believe that the critical communications and control prob- 
lems arising from the present shortage of frequencies available 
to police departments require immediate attention. Accordingly, 
we recommend that the Federal Communications Commission 
make sufficient frequencies available to police and related public 
safety services to meet the demonstrated need for riot control 
and other emergency use.1 

Miniaturized communications equipment for officers on foot 
is critically needed for command and control in civil disorders 
particularly if the riot commanders are to exercise effective 
command and control over police units in control operations. 
At the present time police officers can generally communicate 
only to headquarters and only from a police vehicle. This Com- 
mission, therefore, endorses the recommendations made by the 
Crime Commission that the federal government assume the 
leadership in initiating and funding portable radio development 
programs for the police.2 

(2) Intelligence — The absence of accurate information both 
before and during a disorder has created special control problems 
for police. Police departments must develop means to obtain 
adequate intelligence for planning purposes, as well as on-the- 
scene information for use in police operations during a disorder. 

An intelligence unit staffed with full-time personnel should be 
established to gather, evaluate, analyze, and disseminate infor- 
mation on potential as well as actual civil disorders. It should 
provide police administrators and commanders with reliable 
information essential for assessment and decision-making. It 
should use undercover police personnel and informants but it 
should also draw on community leaders, agencies, and organi- 
zations in the ghetto. 

Planning is also necessary to cope with the ever present prob- 
lem of rumors. A rumor collection center will enable police and 
other officials to counter false and inflammatory reports by giv- 
ing accurate information rapidly to community leaders and 
others in troubled areas. Evaluation of rumors can also provide 
important information about potential disorders. 

In one large city, for example, a "Rumor Central" unit estab- 
lished in the Commission on Human Relations averted trouble. 

irThis recommendation was previously made to the FCC in a letter from 
the Commission, a copy of which is included in the Appendix. The FCC has 
taken steps to make additional frequencies available.

of Justice, a copy of which is included in the Appendix.

When a Negro, after an argument, was shot to death by a white 
store owner who was placed in custody by the police, a rumor 
spread through the neighborhood that the white man would not 
be arrested. This false information was picked up by a radio sta- 
tion and broadcast. But Rumor Central, which received some 500 
telephone calls about the incident, obtained the facts from the 
police and gave those facts to community leaders and news 
media. This appreciably assisted the police in alleviating tension. 

(3) Tactics — In dealing with disorders, police have tradition- 
ally relied principally on the use of various squad formations 
and tactics to disperse crowds. These tactics have been of little 
or no value in some recent disorders marked by roving bands of 
rioters engaged in window breaking, looting and fire-bombing. 

Studies made for the Commission indicate that the police are 
aware of the deficiency. Many police departments admitted that 
traditional riot control methods and squad tactics were wholly 
ineffective or only partially useful in the disorders. But no new 
and practical response to the recent types of disorders has 
emerged. Few departments have evolved new tactics against 
rioters. Even fewer have sent trained personnel to consult with 
officials in cities that have experienced civil disorders. 

The tactics recommended for dealing with the type of dis- 
orders experienced last summer, as well as those that may 
develop in the future, are also presented in the Model Opera- 
tions Plan discussed below. 

(4) Recommendations for Operational Planning — The Com- 
mission believes that model operations plans are needed now. 
They must provide guidelines for police departments in coping 
with civil disorders, including types of disorders that may de- 
velop in the future. 

Acting on these convictions, the Commission has developed a 
model operations plan after consultation with leading police 
officials. Like the mobilization plan, this plan is also being used 
in the Department of Justice training conferences and is now 
undergoing final revision. The Commission recommends that 
this plan be distributed to local and state police departments in 
the same manner as the proposed model mobilization plan. 

Obtaining Outside Assistance — When should a mayor or local 
police chief call for state assistance? The answer is difficult 
partly because of the problem of determining when outside 
assistance is actually necessary, and partly because local officials 
may be understandably reluctant to admit that they cannot 
control the disorder. 

No amount of planning will provide an automatic solution to 
this problem. Sound judgment on the part of mayors and police 
chiefs remains the only answer. Yet once the decision has been 
made, proper advance planning will help speed assistance. 

Outside forces will need a relatively long lead time before 
response. A survey of National Guard capabilities, for example, 
shows that an average of four to six hours is required from the 
time of notification to the time of arrival of an effective comple- 
ment of men. 

Local authorities must not wait until the critical moment to 
alert a neighboring jurisdiction, the state police, or the National 
Guard. Outside control forces will then be unable to mobilize 

488 


and respond on time. All agencies that may be asked to help 
control a civil disturbance must be alerted at an early stage and 
kept informed. 

These problems will be further discussed in the section on the 
National Guard and state-local planning. 

Logistical Planning — Commission studies disclosed serious de- 
ficiencies in police plans for logistical support. Many of these 
plans appear to assume that supplies and equipment will be on 
hand or will be available in the amounts required. The moment 
of need is too late to find out whether they are. 

Regular police vehicles are usually inadequate for transporting 
and supplying large numbers of police, particularly since the 
men should be moved in units. Furthermore, a disorder extending 
over a long period of time will require the resupply of expended 
items and probably food and shelter for police personnel. In one 
city, when the failure to plan for these contingencies kept an 
entire police force on 24-hour duty, physical exhaustion seri- 
ously impaired police effectiveness. 

A major problem in certain of the 1967 disorders arose from 
the large number of persons arrested. Facilities to transport, 
detain, process, feed, and house them were totally inadequate 
and no emergency or contingency planning had been done. This 
logistical problem is discussed in Chapter 13, the Administration 
of Justice under Emergency Conditions. 

Training 

The Commission survey on the capabilities and preparedness 
of selected police departments showed that the most critical 
deficiency of all is in the area of training. Recruits receive an 
average of 18 hours of riot-control training; programs range 
from 62 hours to only 2. Little additional training is provided 
for supervisory and command officers. 

Moreover, although riot control tactics require the work of 
highly disciplined and coordinated teams, almost all depart- 
ments train policemen as individuals. Of the 19 departments 
reporting some post-recruit training for riot-control units, five 
limit training to the use of firearms and chemicals. In many 
cases, the training program is built around traditional military 
formations that have little applicability to the kinds of civil 
disorders experienced by our cities. Yet 50 percent of all the 
departments surveyed said they were generally satisfied with 
their training programs and planned no significant changes. 

Basic riot control should be taught in recruit school, and in- 
tensive unit training should be conducted subsequently on a 
regular basis. Without this kind of training, police officers cannot 
be expected to perform effectively in controlling civil disturb- 
ances. Training supervisory and command personnel in the 
control of civil disorders must also be a continuing process. 

Emergency plans and emergency operations must be reviewed 
in the classroom and practiced in the field. Yet few departments 
test their mobilization and operational plans. As a result, when 
carefully planned variations from the normal chain-of-com- 
mand, communications systems, and unit assignments go into 
effect at a time of riot emergency, policemen are often un- 
familiar with them. The most thoroughly developed emergency 

489 


plan is useless unless all personnel fully understand it before 
it is put into operation. 

Of the 30 police departments surveyed, not a single one re- 
ported coordinated training with fire units. Yet recent experi- 
ence shows a clear need for police-fire teamwork in riots. Even 
more revealing, only 2 of the departments surveyed have under- 
taken coordinated training with other community agencies re- 
quired in a riot emergency. Only 2 departments reported co- 
ordinating their riot control training with the National Guard 
and state police. 

In order to strengthen police training, the Commission recom- 
mends: 

1. Departments should immediately allocate whatever time is 
necessary to reach an effective level of riot control capability. 
The need for training in civil disorder prevention and control 
is urgent. 

2. Training must include all levels of personnel within the 
police agency, especially commanders. Post-recruit riot training 
must be a continuing process for all personnel and build upon 
recruit training rather than duplicate it. 

3. Riot control training must be provided to groups expected 
to function as teams during actual riot conditions. Required 
levels of teamwork can be achieved only through team training. 
All special riot control units must receive additional and in- 
tensive training in tactics and procedures, as well as in special 
equipment and weapons. 

4. Mobilization plans and etnergency procedures must be re- 
viewed in the classroom and practiced in the field. All members 
of the department must be familiar with riot plans at all times. 

5. Mayors and other civil officials must recognize the need 
and accept the responsibility for initiating regional training and 
coordination with military and state police personnel, as well 
as with other agencies of local governments. 

6. Police agencies must review and become familiar with re- 
cent riot experience so that training programs can be realisti- 
cally adjusted in the light of anticipated problems. 

7. In order to help law enforcement agencies improve their 
knowledge and strengthen their capabilities to prevent and con- 
trol civil disorders, a national center and clearinghouse should 
be established to develop, evaluate, and disseminate riot preven- 
tion and control data and information. This center should be 
part of the proposed National Institute for Law Enforcement 
and Administration of Justice recommended by the President 
and awaiting action by Congress. 

A suggestion has been made that national observer teams be 
established and assigned to the scene of incipient or developing 
disorders. These teams would study the effectiveness of control 
techniques and organization, recommend improvements, and 
make this information available to public officials. The Com- 
mission endorses the recommendation and suggests further that 
the disorder observer teams be made an integral part of the 
proposed national center. 

Police Control Equipment 

Personal Equipment — A serious hazard faced by police officers 

490 


during disorders is injury from bottles, rocks, and other missiles 
thrown by rioters. Yet few police departments can furnish every 
man assigned to civil disturbance duty with the proper equip- 
ment to protect head, face, and eyes. The Commission has found 
that protective clothing, boots, and gloves are generally not 
available for the police, although most police administrators 
recommend their procurement and use. Police officers must have 
the proper personal equipment and clothing to safeguard them 
against the threat of bodily harm. 

Police Weapons — On the basis of a survey made of 30 major 
police departments, the Commission found that many police 
forces are inadequately equipped or trained for use of even con- 
ventional riot control weapons and materiel. For example, al- 
though the police baton has proven to be a very effective 
weapon in situations where a low level of physical force will 
control a disorder, many police departments fail to instruct 
their men in the proper use of this control weapon. The value 
of the police baton should not be overlooked and police ad- 
ministrators should assure that proper training in its correct 
and most effective use is given to all police officers. 

The only equipment found to be in adequate supply in police 
departments was hand guns. Experience has shown that these 
are relatively poor and ineffective weapons for dealing with a 
civil disorder. 

The most serious deficiencies, however, are in advanced non- 
lethal weapons. Riot control authorities regard nonlethal chemi- 
cal agents, such as tear gas, as the single most valuable and 
effective type of middle-range weapons in controlling civil dis- 
orders. In listing the priority of force to be applied in a dis- 
order, the FBI manual on riot control, as well as Army and 
National Guard doctrine, prescribe the use of tear gas (CS and 
CN) before resorting to firearms. According to the FBI riot 
control manual: "They are the most effective and most humane 
means of achieving temporary neutralization of a mob with a 
minimum of personal injury." 

While most of the police departments surveyed possessed some 
chemical weapons with varying degrees of supplies on hand, 
they lacked sufficient gas masks to equip even 30% of their 
personnel. The lack of gas masks restricts use of gas by many 
police forces. 

Police and other civil officials have also been inhibited by the 
unfavorable psychological reaction to the use of any gas or 
chemical weapon. An additional restraint is created by the 
presence of large numbers of innocent people in the disorder 
area who would be affected by the traditional, massive use of 
tear gas. 

The recent development of new containers and projectile de- 
vices by the U.S. Army now makes it possible to use CS dis- 
criminatingly against small groups and even individuals. Police 
departments could use them to deal effectively and appropriate- 
ly with looters and snipers. 

Some police departments have recently been equipping police 
officers with a liquid tear gas device. Initial reports indicate 
that, though less effective than CS, it provides a useful method 
of dealing with unruly and dangerous individuals. Used proper- 

491 


ly, it renders offenders harmless for 10 to 15 minutes. Pro- 
jectors now in production promise to give police a means of 
acting against lawless small groups or individuals up to a dis- 
tance of 30 feet. 

The use of distinctive colors and odors either added to a 
chemical agent or projected from a separate device may be an 
additional way to help police not only identify those engaged in 
vandalism and other illegal acts but also deter others. 

The exaggerated reports of sniping in many cities experienc- 
ing disorders created unwarranted apprehension among some 
police administrators. This concern has led to a belief in some 
communities that police officers should be armed with highly 
destructive implements of war. 

The Commission believes that equipping civil police with 
automatic rifles, machine guns, and other weapons of massive 
and indiscriminate destructive force is not warranted by the evi- 
dence. Chemical agents provide police forces with an effective 
and more appropriate weapon. If violence by rioters goes beyond 
the capability of the police to control, trained military forces 
should be called in. We should not attempt to convert our police 
into combat troops equipped for urban warfare. 

The true source of police strength in maintaining order lies in 
the respect and good will of the public they serve. Great harm 
is likely to result from the use of military weapons of mass 
destruction by police forces which lack the command and con- 
trol and firearms discipline of military units. Improper action 
could destroy the concept of civilian police as a public service 
agency dependent for effective operations on community co- 
operation and support. 

Overall Recommendations — The development of modern, non- 
lethal control equipment has languished because police depart- 
ments lack the resources for tests and evaluation. The de- 
centralized nature of law enforcement and the absence of 
standard criteria have also limited market opportunities. As a 
result, private industry has been reluctant to invest in research 
and development of new police equipment. 

Accordingly, the Commission recommends: 

• The federal government should undertake an immediate 
program to test and evaluate available nonlethal wea- 
pons and related control equipment for use by police 
and control forces. 

• Federal support should be provided to establish criteria 
and standard specifications which would stimulate and 
facilitate the production of such items at a reasonably 
low cost. 

• Federal funds should be used to develop appropriate 
tools and materiel for local and state law enforcement 
agencies. 

If these recommendations are adopted, the result will be 
better maintenance of law and order and better control of dis- 
orders with fewer risks to police and the public. Use should be 
made of the technology and resources of the Department of 
Defense and other appropriate federal agencies.

II. Fire Departments and Civil Disorders 

Of the 23 cities studied by the Commission, most reported 
arson and fires accompanying the disorders, ranging from the 
burning of police barricades in Jackson, Mississippi, to the 682 
riot-connected fires listed by the Detroit Fire Department. 
Fire departments face problem^ equal in difficulty to the 
control problems of law enforcement agencies. 

Major Fire Department Problems in Civil Disorders 

Abnormal Number of Fires — The basic problem for fire depart- 
ments during a civil disorder is lack of resources to cope with 
an abnormal number of fires in one area while maintaining some 
coverage for other areas. Detroit had as many fires in the five 
days of disorder as it usually has in a month. No other city 
approached this number of fires during a disorder, but fire prob- 
lems were still critical. For example, during the four days of 
disorder in Newark, the fire department responded to 250 fire 
calls, plus 64 false alarms, and 50 emergencies where no fire 
existed. Of these 364 calls, 166 took place on the first day of the 
disorder. 

Fire departments are not organized or equipped to cope with 
an abnormal number of fires on a sustained basis. There are 
more than 23,500 public fire departments in the United States, 
and only 285 have 100 or more employees. Only 19 cities have 
more than 1,000 paid employees, ranging from 13,917 in New 
York City to 1,061 in New Orleans. But total strength is far 
from the number of men available to fight a fire. Regular hours 
of duty mean that only 20 to 35 percent of personnel are on duty 
at any one time. The situation is even more critical in the sub- 
urban communities surrounding the core city of a metropolitan 
area, for many of these departments depend to a very large 
extent on volunteer firemen even for routine fires, and few have 
as many as 25 men normally on duty. 

Shortages of equipment, particularly reserve equipment neces- 
sary for a full utilization of all available manpower, also inhibit 
efforts to combat widespread fires. During the Detroit disorder, 
41 suburban communities furnished men and about 56 pieces of 
equipment to augment the 92 pieces of equipment in the city 
department. The danger in relying on mutual aid agreements 
comes from the possibility that adjoining communities may be 
simultaneously involved in a disorder and unable to release men 
or equipment. 

Malicious or Nuisance False Alarms — False alarms have often 
plagued fire departments during disorders. These alarms over- 
load incoming communications systems and deplete manpower 
and equipment needed for actual fires. 

Attacks on and Harassment of Firemen — In many of the cities 
experiencing civil disorders, firemen have been harassed, and 
even attacked, primarily by thrown objects. These, plus fear of 
attack, have seriously interfered with the work of firemen. Fire- 
men can no longer depend upon community assistance, but must 
be ready for open hostility. 

Overtaxed Communication Facilities — Fire department com- 

493 


munication capabilities have been severely taxed during dis- 
orders. At headquarters, increased number of alarms overload 
incoming telephone lines, and impose heavy burdens on dis- 
patchers. In the field, frequencies have been overloaded, while 
the use of different frequencies by fire units, law enforcement 
agencies and National Guard forces has prompted confusion. 
The Commission has requested that the Federal Communica- 
tions Commission provide sufficient frequencies to permit com- 
munication during disorders among all agencies of government 
involved in control. 

Identification of a Civil Disorder Fire Problem — The fire prob- 
lem in a civil disorder has usually developed after the initial 
disturbance. The time interval may be a matter of hours as in 
Detroit, or a matter of days as in Los Angeles in 1965. In order 
to insure efficient response, fire chiefs must identify the start 
of a problem as early as possible both to activate emergency 
plans and to avoid an initial over-commitment of resources. 

Water Supply Problems — Numerous fires reduce water pres- 
sure, and malicious openings of hydrants deplete water supplies. 

Logistical Support — Extended fire-fighting operations by large 
numbers of personnel and equipment have created serious logis- 
tical problems. Sufficient manpower and equipment must be on 
hand not only to combat the fires but also to avert long hours 
of duty leading to exhaustion. Special feeding and rest facilities 
near the center of operations should be provided. 

The availability and state of repair of reserve equipment cre- 
ates additional difficulties when this equipment is pressed into 
service during an emergency. 

Large scale glass breakage during disorders has damaged tires 
of fire trucks. Hose problems have been acute. Most fire depart- 
ments lack the heavy stream equipment that is most efficient 
in handling riot-caused fires. Forced withdrawals because of 
attacks on firemen and rapid reassignment to new threatened 
areas have prevented recovery of hose. Damage from large scale 
operations, as well as from sabotage, has further reduced hose 
inventories. 

Recommendations for Improving Fire Department Response 

Planning — The Commission recommends that fire depart- 
ments evaluate all existing resources, develop and test plans of 
response, and make every effort to strengthen the fire-fighting 
force within the limits of the community's financial base. Be- 
yond this, detailed plans must be prepared to: 

• identify areas where disorders and fires are likely to 
occur. 

• compute the units needed to service critical areas, while 
maintaining minimum protection for the remainder of 
the community. 

• evaluate jointly total needs with cooperating agencies 
and schedule required assignments in advance. 

• select command post sites, providing for a command 
room, adequate parking of apparatus, sufficient access 
and maneuver, communication facilities, and space for 
personnel for extended periods of time. 

494 


• provide for coded signals to implement responses, to ac- 
tivate command posts, and to recall off-duty personnel. 

• choose special teams of men and equipment for commit- 
ment, including, normally, one or two pumpers, a ladder 
truck, a chief officer, necessary heavy equipment, and 
communication facilities. 

• review the adequacy of the water supply and plan for 
foreseeable problems in advance. 

• develop plans for actual operations at the scene of fires. 

• provide a way to screen incoming alarms to avoid dupli- 
cation of response and depletion of resources. 

Coordination and Liaison with Other Units — Fire departments 
must be an integral part of the planning to coordinate all 
government agencies and private groups involved in control 
operations, in particular with law enforcement agencies and the 
National Guard. Effective liaison must be established well in 
advance of emergencies, and lines of communication to the po- 
lice will provide both information for the prompt recognition 
of special fire problems and police protection. Tests of all agree- 
ments are a necessity. 

Protection of Firemen — A fireman is neither trained nor 
equipped to control rioters. To be effective, he must be able to 
devote his entire attention to fire control activities. Since fire- 
men have a professional responsibility and duty to respond to 
all fires, protection furnished by outside sources may be neces- 
sary for the personal well-being of firemen, and for effective 
fire-fighting operations. 

Thus, if firemen are attacked or severely harassed or interfered 
with in their operations, either police or National Guardsmen 
should be assigned to fire units, to furnish effective protection. 
In order to ensure that proper protection will be immediately 
available if needed, advance commitments and assignments are 
necessary. Firemen must establish and maintain liaison with top 
police officials and National Guard officers. 

Personal protective equipment for firemen and apparatus may 
also be necessary — covered cabs, eye shields and crash helmets, 
as well as covering material for fire engines. 

Adequate Communication Equipment — Adequate communica- 
tions between headquarters and field operations are essential — 
additional telephones to receive alarms; direct-line telephones to 
command posts and key officials; portable two-way radios; radio 
links to other agencies and cooperating fire departments; equip- 
ment for reserve units; and reliable means to direct firefighters 
to fire scenes. Periodic exercises and tests are necessary. 

Logistical Support — To ensure an adequate logistical support, 
fire departments must make an inventory of all equipment and 
supplies, repair or replace inoperative or defective equipment, 
and ensure adequate repair and maintenance facilities. Suffi- 
cient quantities of hose, particularly heavy stream and large 
diameter hose, are required. 

Training — Because operations during civil disorders differ sub- 
stantially from normal operating procedures, training must be 
carried out at operational and command levels. Command level 
training is of special importance, for many fire department offi- 

495 


cials lack experience in wide-scale operations. Tactical exercises 
will help train senior staff officers and test communications and 
command capabilities. 

Training and Planning Conferences — The Commission recom- 
mends training conferences for the nation's fire departments. 
Nationwide or areawide conferences among top fire department 
officials will promote exchanges of information relating to basic 
plans for responding to disorders and the preparation of train- 
ing programs and materials for both operational and command 
levels. The Federal Government should assume the responsi- 
bility for instituting, and funding such conferences. 

Improved Community Relations — Fire departments, like police 
departments, must improve their relations with the communi- 
ties they serve in order to gain the community cooperation and 
assistance that are essential for effective fire-fighting. This re- 
quires getting out of the fire house and becoming acquainted 
with the people in the neighborhood. Fire department officials 
have an obligation to develop programs to achieve these goals. 

III. State Response To Civil Disorders 

A major civil disorder may require control forces beyond the 
personnel and equipment of a single city. When this occurs in 
an American city, the response will necessarily be far different 
than it would be in many foreign countries. The reported suc- 
cess of various foreign countries in rapidly suppressing civil 
disorders is due principally to their capability to rapidly deploy 
and command large numbers of specially trained and equipped 
riot-control personnel. This is possible because most foreign 
countries have large national police forces under centralized 
control. 

Because a national police force is contrary to American tra- 
dition, and because the use of federal forces in domestic vio- 
lence is limited by the Constitution, governing statutes, and 
precedent, state forces alone will be available in the great ma- 
jority of civil disorders in this country. The state forces pres- 
ently available to assist local law enforcement agencies are the 
state police and the National Guard. 

State Police Forces 

All states except Hawaii have a state police department, high- 
way patrol, or department of public safety. Together they num- 
ber approximately 32,500 sworn personnel. All but seven states 
have under 1,000 men. The great majority of them have only 
a few hundred. In most states, these officers are respon- 
sible for policing the entire highway system and must be gen- 
erally dispersed over the entire state. Thus, state police depart- 
ments find it difficult to mobilize sufficient numbers of men to 
be of appreciable help in assisting local police control a civil 
disorder. 

In fact, traffic supervision rather than law enforcement is the 
chief function in more than half of the states. Twelve of the 49 
departments lack full police powers. Only five spend less than 
half time on traffic; 27 spend three-quarters or more time on 

496 


traffic. Only eight spend over 15 percent of their time on control 
of criminal activities. 

In the comparatively few states where the departments spend 
appreciable time on crime control, they may be the principal law 
enforcement agency for many rural areas. To divert these forces 
to riot control activities would strip rural areas of police pro- 
tection. 

Although state police recruits in 44 states receive training in 
crowd and riot-control tactics, the average number of hours for 
such training is approximately 10, as compared to 39 for the 
state traffic code and 38 for accident investigation. 

Thus, most state police forces lack the necessary manpower, 
training, and operational structure to assist local police effec- 
tively in controlling civil disorders. In the great majority of 
states, only the National Guard can furnish effective assistance. 

National Guard 

During the period from the end of World War II through 
February of 1968, the National Guard has been summoned to 
aid in controlling civil disturbances approximately 100 times in 
33 states. Eighteen took place during the summer of 1967 (June 
through August) . The performance of Guard forces in certain 
disorders, particularly in Newark and Detroit, raised doubts re- 
garding their capabilities for this type of mission. 

Their performance also poses a serious challenge to the nation. 
Because of the limitations of state police and the restrictions on 
the use of federal forces, the National Guard in state status is 
the only organization with sufficient manpower and appropriate 
organization and equipment which can materially assist local 
police departments in riot control operations. 

After hearing testimony and reviewing evidence of the Guard's 
performance in riot control operations in several cities, this 
Commission recommended immediate action to improve the 
Guard's effectiveness. These recommendations included: 

(1) increased riot control training. 

(2) review of the standards for National Guard officers. 

(3) a substantial increase in Negro personnel in both Army 
and Air National Guard. 

These recommendations provoked changes in the Guard. Our 
evaluation will take these changes into account. 

Background Information on the Guard — Certain difficulties 
experienced by the Guard in responding to civil disorders result 
from the dual nature of its organization and mission. On one 
hand, it is a state militia organized, trained, and equipped to 
protect life and property and preserve order and public safety 
within the state it serves. On the other hand, it has a federal 
mission to provide organized units of trained personnel with 
sufficient and suitable equipment to augment the active Army 
and Air Force in time of war or national emergency. 

National Guard officials maintain that their primary duty 
is to be ready to respond to the federal mission. For the Guard's 
force structure is tailored by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to enable 
its immediate integration into the active Army and Air Force. 
The Army prescribes standards for enlistment, and for the ap- 
pointment and promotion of officers; the Army directs training. 

497 


A federal order to duty has priority over a state call. The Federal 
Government pays for 90 percent of the operating costs, vir- 
tually all of the equipment, and nearly half the cost of the 
physical installations and facilities. 

Yet members of the Guard take an oath of allegiance to the 
state. Unless called into federal service, and except when on 
annual two weeks tour of active duty, the Guard is under the 
control of the Governor, who appoints officers. When on state 
duty, the Guard is paid by the state and is subject to state or 
local control. The concept of a state militia is enhanced by the 
"hometown" makeup and traditions of Guard units. 

This dual nature of Guard makeup and mission must be taken 
into account when Guard capabilities for use in riot control 
operations are assessed, and when responsibility for improve- 
ments is fixed. 

Here we consider the Guard's control capabilities in terms of 
personnel, organization, planning, training and equipment, as 
presently in being. 

Personnel Resources — 

(1) Sufficiency of Manpower— The total strength of the Na- 
tional Guard is determined by Congress in response to require- 
ments set by the Department of Defense. The manpower level 
has varied little over the past several years. 

Although the National Guard Bureau and the Adjutants Gen- 
eral of the states participate in the process, establishing Guard 
strength in any state and allocating Guard units to a particular 
state are primarily federal functions based upon the needs of 
the active Army in the event of a national emergency. A Gov- 
ernor can refuse the total Guard manpower allocated to his 
state, in which case the excess manpower is assigned to other 
states. A Governor can also increase the total manpower as- 
signed, but there would be no federal recognition or support of 
the additional units. 

In the recent past, no state has called its total Guard force 
to active duty to deal with civil disorders. Since 1957, the aver- 
age proportion of the force employed has been nine percent; in 
only two instances has a state employed more than 50 percent 
of Guard strength. Calif ornia called out 60 percent for the Watts 
riot in 1965. Michigan called 85 percent for the Detroit disorder 
in 1967, but held 20 to 25 percent in reserve near Detroit. New 
Jersey employed 31 percent of its Guard in Newark, Wisconsin 
about 43 percent for Milwaukee. Even if civil disorders increase 
somewhat in frequency and magnitude, Guard strength appears 
adequate to assist local law enforcement units. 

Other factors must, however, be considered. First, without the 
pressure of the accelerated draft in times of international crisis, 
the Guard usually has difficulty maintaining its strength. Sec- 
ond, no state has yet experienced more than one major civil 
disorder at any one time. Two or more major disturbances would 
probably necessitate outside help. Third, control of an extremely 
severe or prolonged disorder would undoubtedly be beyond the 
present capabilities of any state. And, fourth, repeated disorders 
in a state would create manpower problems since calling the 
same units to duty several times in a short period would cause 
severe dislocations for the men involved. 

498 


In summary, no state alone has the resources to support a 
Guard force capable of controlling all potential disorders, but 
no state can be expected to maintain a force of that strength. 
Elsewhere in this Report the Commission will consider the prob- 
lem of obtaining outside aid. 

(2) Quality of Guard Officers— Total manpower is not the 
only factor in an evaluation of Guard capabilities for control 
purposes. Proper leadership at all levels is vital to prevent the 
indiscriminate riot control measures utilized by some Guard 
units in recent disorders. 

Evidence presented to the Commission concerning Guard 
performance in recent control operations brought into question 
the caliber and competence of certain Guard officers. Some dis- 
played inferior leadership below the level needed to handle the 
extremely sensitive operations of controlling disorder in an 
American city. As a result, the Commission recommended that 
the qualifications and performance of all Guard officers be 
reviewed. This recommendation was intended not as a reflec- 
tion on the entire officer corps of the Guard, but rather to sug- 
gest that objective tests be used to replace or retrain officers 
who failed to meet minimum standards of leadership. 

Prompt action was taken on the Commission's recommenda- 
tions. A special board was formed to make a general assessment 
of the qualifications and performance of all Reserve Component 
officers. The Commission assumes that the Department of the 
Army will continue these efforts and will work with the states 
to upgrade or eliminate officers who lack the necessary leader- 
ship attributes. 

The responsibility to improve Guard leadership does not rest 
solely with the Federal Government. Governors appoint Guard 
officers, and they too must exercise responsibility to improve 
Guard leadership by selecting only the well qualified. 

(3) Negro Personnel in Guard Units — Evidence from Detroit 
indicates that active Army troops were more effective than 
National Guard units in controlling the disorder. According to 
many observers, the higher percentage of Negroes in the Active 
Army was a significant contributing factor. After reviewing this 
evidence and examining the percentage of Negroes in Guard 
units, this commission recommended immediate efforts to in- 
crease substantially the number of Negroes in Army and Air 
National Guard units. (See letter to President Johnson, p. 570.) 

The Department of Defense responded in two ways: 

(a) On August 31, 1967, a special Board was convened to study 
the extent of Negro participation in the Army National Guard 
and Reserve, to explore the reasons why Negroes were not fully 
participating, and to suggest a program to increase their par- 
ticipation substantially. On October 16, 1967, the Board issued 
its report and recommended steps to recruit and retain addi- 
tional Negro personnel. 

(b) The New Jersey National Guard was authorized a tempo- 
rary 5 percent overstrength — 865 additional spaces— in its paid 
drill strength. The purpose was to test methods of increasing 
Negro participation in the Army and Air National Guard. An 
intensive recruiting program was immediately instituted to ob- 
tain qualified Negroes for the additional positions. By the end 
of December, 1967, approximately 1300 Negroes had expressed 

499 


interest in the Guard. Of 723 whose applications were fully 
processed, 397 were actually enlisted into the Army and Air Na- 
tional Guard. Thus, approximately 46 percent of the over- 
strength positions have been filled, amounting to an increase of 
Negro participation in the New Jersey Guard from 1.7 percent on 
December 31, 1966, to 3.97 percent at the end of December 1967. 
The program is continuing. 

The Commission commends these efforts. Although it is too 
early to determine whether the New Jersey program will be a 
complete success, preliminary results indicate that Negro par- 
ticipation in the Guard can be increased. The Commission rec- 
ommends that the findings of the special board and the results 
of the New Jersey experiment be fully utilized to stimulate ad- 
ditional Negro participation. If necessary, overstrengths should 
be authorized. 

Every effort must be made to ensure fair assignments and pro- 
motions for Negroes. Increased Negro participation in the Guard 
will have meaning only if there is a fair proportion of Negro 
officers in command of integrated units. 

Organization — Unit organization in the Guard is identical to 
active Army organization. Command and control arrangements 
are also identical, ensuring close supervision of troops and quick 
and flexible reaction to changing situations. 

Command organization of the Guard is currently undergoing 
a modification which brings into a sharp focus potential con- 
flicts between the state and federal missions of the National 
Guard. In the opinion of experienced consultants, the basic 
military element that lends itself most effectively to riot control 
is the battalion. However, the current plan splits support type 
battalions between various states with the resulting loss of at 
least one unified battalion in each state where divisions are split. 

The Commission recommends that the Department of Defense 
reconsider alignment of units between the states in order to 
ensure that state needs for unified command and control in riot 
operations are fully taken into account. 

Planning — The importance of planning in effective control 
operations cannot be overemphasized. Planning is particularly 
important for the National Guard because it needs to mobilize a 
large number of men from a variety of locations and occupations, 
be sure they are properly equipped, deploy them rapidly in ef- 
fective units to the scene of the disorder, and provide adequate 
logistical support for expanded operations. 

The Department of the Army in August 1967 instructed all 
National Guard commands to develop riot-control plans. A re- 
vised training schedule issued at the same time required an 
8-hour command-post exercise to develop plans or exercise pre- 
viously developed plans. All National Guard units have now met 
this requirement. 

The commanding general of the United States Continental 
Army Command has dispatched liaison teams to review all state 
National Guard riot-control plans and to assure that they are 
coordinated with plans drawn by state and local civil officials. 

The Army has also developed planning packets for certain 
cities. These include maps and other information necessary for 
control operations. 

500 


The Department of the Army and the National Guard Bureau 
have provided a basic framework which helps the states con- 
struct appropriate riot-control plans. The states now have a clear 
responsibility to develop them. 

In order to aid appropriate federal and state officials fulfill 
their planning responsibilities, the Commission makes the fol- 
lowing recommendations: 

(1) The 8 -hour command post exercise mentioned above is 
inadequate for proper drafting of control plans. The Commission 
believes that riot-control plans should be developed by the state 
Adjutant General working together with his full-time duty staff, 
rather than during a training exercise. The Commission also 
suggests that the Military Support of Civil Defense section be 
utilized to assist in the planning process. Only if the planning 
is carried out in this fashion by full-time personnel will there 
be adequate opportunity to develop a workable and comprehen- 
sive plan, and also to exploit fully the training exercises devoted 
to testing and revision of the plans. We are informed that the 
Department of the Army is presently taking steps that would 
substantially carry out this recommendation. 

(2) The planning process must involve all state and local of- 
ficials who will be involved in the control operations. It cannot 
be left solely to the Army and National Guard, nor to the Na- 
tional Guard and police departments. 

(3) The lack of adequate communication between the Guard 
and local agencies has been a problem in nearly all instances 
where National Guard troops have been utilized to assist in 
controlling a disorder. Proper planning must insure effective 
communications among all Guard units involved, as well as 
among the Guard and appropriate local agencies, particularly 
the police and fire departments. 

(4) Planning should take into account those National Guards- 
men who are policemen, firemen, and other emergency workers. 
They must be released from active military duty on a case-by- 
case basis if they are needed in their civilian capacities. 

(5) Plans must be constantly reviewed to ensure their ap- 
plicability to changing conditions and new techniques and 
equipment. 

(6) An officer should be on duty at the state Guard head- 
quarters on a 24-hour basis to ensure proper contact with state 
and local civil officials and law enforcement agencies. Guard 
headquarters should maintain regular contacts with all major 
state and local law enforcement agencies in order to provide for 
an exchange of information, particularly intelligence. 

(7) All states should plan to have Guard cadres, key person- 
nel, and even some units, available for rapid call-up during the 
crucial warm-weather months. This will provide a minimum 
force for immediate aid to local law enforcement agencies and 
will facilitate full mobilization and deployment if necessary. A 
force of this nature can be created by placing personnel on an 
alert status (subject to recall on short notice) on a rotating 
basis, or by scheduling weekend training for various Guard units. 
It is useful to recall that in 17 of the 24 disorders studied by the 
Commission, the disorders began during a weekend, or on a Fri- 
day or Monday. 

Weapons, Equipment and Logistical Support— The Guard is 

501 


armed and equipped by federal funds in order to fulfill its fed- 
eral role as a combat force. Experiences of this last summer 
reveal that much of this equipment is inappropriate for dealing 
with civil disorders in American cities. The Guard and Army 
units lack an adequate "middle ground" between a display of 
force and the use of lethal or indiscriminate force. 

The Commission has recommended federally sponsored and 
financed research for developing nonlethal weapons. The Com- 
mission further recommends that the Department of Defense 
participate fully in such efforts to bring about full utilization of 
available resources. Suitable products of research and develop- 
ment should be used to the fullest extent possible by the Na- 
tional Guard and Army, as well as by local and state police. 

In the foreseeable future, however, the National Guard has no 
alternative but to use existing equipment in control opera- 
tions. 

(1) Individual Weapons — The rifle is the soldier's basic weap- 
on. He has been trained with it and has developed a degree of 
confidence in it. This weapon has a psychological effect for a 
show of force that distinguishes military units from the police. 
Unf ortunately, actual use of the rifle in riot control operations is 
generally inappropriate. It is a lethal weapon with ammunition 
designed to kill at great distances. Rifle bullets ricochet. They 
may kill or maim innocent people blocks away from the actual 
target. 

Unless or until an effective nonlethal replacement for the rifle 
is developed, it will of necessity continue to be the basic arm 
for the individual guardsman assigned to civil disorder duty. 
The Commission recommends that the Department of Defense 
immediately institute a research program that seeks to develop 
a new type of ammunition for use in civil disorders. It should 
be capable of striking with deterrent but not lethal force at 
reasonable range. British units in Hong Kong, for example, fire 
a wooden peg that incorporates these basic features and is re- 
portedly highly effective. 

(2) Bayonets — Considerable controversy developed around the 
use of bayonets by National Guard and Army troops in con- 
trolling riots. Proponents of this weapon argue that it has the 
strong psychological impact necessary for an effective show of 
force, and provides a means of self-defense for the individual 
guardsman. Opponents point out that bayonets are likely to 
cause death or severe wounds and may inflame a crowd to 
greater disorder. 

One commentator, after pointing out that successful modern 
armies have trained men to perform effectively in combat with- 
out bayonets, concludes: 

In any case, the bayonet is completely useless as an in- 
strument of riot control and the management of civil 
disorder. As a device for separating hostile groups or 
controlling mobs, it has some of the impact of a police 
dog, in that it produces counter-effects that are not de- 
sired. It is not a weapon which reassures soldiers, es- 
pecially national guardsmen; federal troops tend to 
avoid its use. Even in most difficult riot control situations 

502 


which faced British forces as for example in Hong Kong, 
the bayonet was absent.3 

The Commission recommends that the Department of the 
Army and the National Guard Bureau reexamine their policy 
underlying the use of the bayonet for riot control operations. 
At the very minimum, the Commission believes that nomethal 
chemical agents should be utilized beiore bayonets are nxed. 

(3) Chemical Agents — The National Guard is equipped with 
CS, the standard Army chemical agent for riot control. The 
Army has recently developed a variety 01 dispensers that include 
small hand-thrown rubber grenades; grenade launchers accurate 
to a range of 200 meters and useiul, for example, against a sniper 
firing through a window; and large devices that can be mounted 
on helicopters and disperse effective amounts of the agent over 
relatively large areas. These should be made available to Guard 
units as soon as possible. 

Despite the existence of some problems, previously discussed 
in the control chapter, the only present alternative to use of CS 
is the application of potentially lethal force. New delivery pro- 
jectiles now enable CS to be used in a more discriminating 
manner against individuals or small groups, and they can pro- 
vide more flexibility in the present range of coercive force. The 
Commission, therefore, believes that until more selective non- 
lethal weapons are available, CS should be utilized before rifles 
and bayonets. The Commission urges the Department of Defense 
to expedite the development and production of advanced de- 
livery systems, which should also be made available to police 
departments. 

It is important to avoid the indiscriminate use of chemical 
agents. Special care is required when used in densely populated 
areas. Whenever they are used, clear advance warning should be 
given to all who may be affected, and adequate escape routes 
should be opened to allow a crowd to disperse upon being so 
ordered. 

All National Guard units should have on hand a sufficient 
number of gas masks to equip all guardsmen who may be used 
in riot control operations. Furthermore, each participating unit 
should have a supply of additional gas masks for police and 
other officials who may be attached to or involved with the Na- 
tional Guard in control operations. Utilization of chemical agents 
presents sufficiently difficult problems of judgment for a com- 
mander; the difficulties should not be enhanced by a lack of 
protective equipment. 

(4) Automatic and Other Weapons — The Commission has 
heard from witnesses and its own investigators disturbing ac- 
counts of indiscriminate firing of machine guns during certain 
of the recent disorders. 

Controlling a civil disorder is not warfare. The fundamental 
objective of National Guard forces in a civil disorder is to con- 

3 "Social Control of Escalated Riots," by Morris Janowitz, Professor and 
Chairman of the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago. 
(Paper prepared for the University of Chicago Center for Policy Study, Con- 
ference on Short-Term and Emergency Measures to Avoid Urban Violence.) 

503 


trol the rioters, not to destroy them or any innocent bystanders 
who may be present. 

Brigadier ueneral Harris W. Hollis, Director of Operations, 
Office ox cne deputy Chief of Staff for Military Operations, U.S. 
Army, testified beiore the Commission: 

Commanders and their personnel should do whatever is 
possible to avoid appearing as an alien, invading force 
rather than as a force which has the purpose of restoring 
order with minimum loss of life and property, and with 
due respect for the great number of citizens whose in- 
volvement in the area is purely coincidental. 

A military machine gun — as well as similar types of automatic 
weapons — is constructed to fire bursts or continuous streams 
of deadly ammunition a great distance and over a relatively 
large area. A machine gun, unlike a standard rifle, cannot be 
fired at individuals with selectivity or accuracy. By design it is 
a weapon of mass destruction. Except in an extraordinary situa- 
tion, where the Guard or the local community is endangered by 
the use of lethal weapons that can be neutralized only by mass 
fire, and only if there is no disproportionate danger to innocent 
persons, the Commission recommends that the use of machine 
guns be prohibited for National Guard forces assigned to riot 
control. Other mass destruction weapons of modern warfare — 
flame throwers, recoilless rifles, and artillery — have no con- 
ceivable place in riot-control operations in densely populated 
American cities. 

(5) Communication Equipment — The Commission has pre- 
viously emphasized that proper planning must include facilities 
for adequate communication between the Guard and other 
agencies involved in control operations. Both the Federal Gov- 
ernment and the states should take appropriate steps to insure 
that adequate equipment is immediately available to Guard units 
involved in control operations. 

The Commission has been informed that the Department of 
Defense is now equipping National Guard forces with tactical 
communications equipment and that the Army is developing 
prepackaged communications systems prescribed for use in 
major civil disturbances, systems that can be moved to an af- 
fected area in a minimum amount of time. 

The Commission appreciates the importance of these prepa- 
rations and recommends that these plans be fully executed im- 
mediately. 

(6) Miscellaneous Equipment— Several other items of equip- 
ment have proved useful in riot-control activities. Some are 
available from civilian sources, others only through military 
supply channels. In either case, these items should be immedi- 
ately available if the need arises: 

(a) Armored vehicles — Both Army and National Guard units 
have found that armored personnel carriers are effective for 
moving troops through areas which may be subject to sniper fire 
or to approach buildings from which snipers may be firing. For 
National Guard units in states where such equipment is not 
available, armored trucks, such as the type used by banks, have 
been found effective. They have the added advantage of being 

504 


less conspicious than military armored vehicles. The use of 
tanks, however, is clearly inappropriate because of their potential 
for mass destruction. 

(b) Illumination equipment — The Detroit experience demon- 
strated that it may be highly desirable to illuminate large areas. 
Powerful portable light sources have been developed and are 
available for mounting on helicopters or vehicles. Army search- 
lights are appropriate. Advertising and display companies in 
most major cities have lights, often obtained from Army surplus, 
that can be useful. 

(c) Public address systems — Loudspeaker systems, both hand- 
carried and larger, are essential for warning and directing 
crowds. 

(d) Material for constructing roadblocks — In the Watts riot, 
the Guard experienced major difficulties in constructing 
effective roadblocks. In many instances, when the troops lacked 
adequate materials, they resorted to gunfire to stop vehicles. 
Damage and loss of life resulted. All Guard units should make 
arrangements to obtain suitable materials for constructing 
effective roadblocks, which should # be marked by signs to 
warn  citizens. 

(7) Logistical Support — If logistical planning has been ade- 
quate, no serious deficiencies in equipment and supplies should 
hamper Guard units engaged in riot-control duty. 

Training — Before August, 1967, Army regulations required Na- 
tional Guard units to conduct riot-control training, but speci- 
fied no particular number of hours. Instruction, consequently, 
varied from a minimum of six hours in one state to a maximum 
of 32 hours in another. In addition, the general military train- 
ing received by National Guard troops during their six months 
of active duty and ongoing drills was also applicable to riot 
control. 

In August, 1967, the Army increased mandatory riot-control 
training to 32 hours of unit training, and 16 hours of command 
and staff training, for all Army National Guard units and cer- 
tain designated Air National Guard units. By the end of Oc- 
tober, 1967, all state forces had completed this required training. 

The Commission commends the Department of Defense, the 
Department of the Army, and the National Guard Bureau for 
their prompt action in increasing the riot-control training of the 
National Guard. But in view of the reliance upon the National 
Guard as the main source of support for local police in control- 
ling disorders, the Commission recommends that further steps 
be taken to improve training : 

(1) The 16 hours allotted to command training is insufficient 
to complete the designated review of applicable military sub- 
jects and also the preparation and review of operational and 
mobilization plans. Therefore, the Commission earlier recom- 
mended that actual preparation of plans be left to the full-time 
staff. The 8 hours allocated to the Command Post Exercise 
should be devoted fully to testing plans to determine their gen- 
eral adequacy. If such testing reveals defects, revisions should 
be made, and further training time made available to test the 
revised plans. 

(2) Riot-control training for National Guard troops should 
be a continuing part of the regular training program, to ensure 

505 


familiarity with established procedures and to train incoming 
recruits. 

(3) Riot-control training, and all training materials, should 
be subject to periodic review in order to ensure that they fully 
incorporate the latest techniques developed by the Army, the 
National Guard, and the state and local law enforcement units. 
A special Subcommittee of the House Committee on Armed 
Services (Special Subcommittee to Inquire into the Capability 
of the National Guard to Cope with Civil Disturbances) has 
recommended that the Department of the Army establish a 
permanent Board of Officers to supervise the development and 
testing of civil disturbance control measures and equipment, and 
to develop and periodically publish revised training directives. 
We believe that this recommendation is sound and we endorse 
it. Such a board could carry out our recommendation for periodic 
review of training materials. 

(4) All Guard units should cooperate fully with efforts to in- 
tegrate National Guard training with that of state and local 
police. If necessary, Guard commanders should take the initia- 
tive in proposing such training. 

(5) Guard training for control activities should include pro- 
visions to ensure that Guard officers and men are fully aware of 
the organization, procedures, and capabilities of other law en- 
forcement and government agencies that may also be involved 
in control activities. 

(6) Guard training should include increased emphasis on the 
community relations aspects of control operations. 

(7) Until all National Guard officers have received thorough 
training in riot-control activities, each state should designate 
appropriate senior officers for command of riot-control opera- 
tions. The Department of the Army should establish a school to 
train these officers for command during riot situations, with 
special emphasis on the political, sociological, and legal prob- 
lems that are involved in control operations. We have been in- 
formed that planning for such a course is currently underway. 

(8) Top Federal, State, and Guard officials must make every 
effort to ensure that training directives are fully carried out, 
and that every guardsman is made aware of the importance of 
all aspects of riot-control training. In particular, emphasis 
should be placed on the importance of using only the minimum 
force necessary to achieve control. 

IV. Army Response To Civil Disorders 

The commitment of federal troops to aid state and local forces 
in controlling a disorder is an extraordinary act. Only twice in 
the last 35 years have governors requested federal troops to help 
quell civil disorders. 

As pointed out elsewhere in this report, however, it is imper- 
ative that states have back-up forces for controlling major dis- 
orders. This section considers the capabilities and preparedness 
of the active Army to perform the back-up function. 

An Army Staff Task Group has recently examined and re- 
viewed a wide range of topics relating to military operations to 
control urban disorders: command and control, logistics, train- 
ing, planning, doctrine, personnel, public information, intelli- 

506 


gence, and legal aspects. The study also extracted lessons from 
recent disorders and sought to make them applicable to any pos- 
sible future disturbances. 

The Commission, in preparing this portion of the report, has 
relied heavily upon information developed by the Army Task 
Group established in the office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for 
Military Operations and commends the Army for undertaking 
this overall review of the Army function. It recommends that 
each state consider a similar review of its own control capa- 
bilities. It further recommends that the results of the Army 
review be made known to the National Guard and to top state 
and local civil and law enforcement officers in order to stimu- 
late review at the state and local level. 

Manpower * 

The active Army has designated seven task forces, each of 
brigade size (approximately 2,000 men), to be immediately avail- 
able for assignment to control civil disorders in the event fed- 
eral troops are needed. Additional Army, as well as Marine 
Corps, forces can be furnished if necessary. 

In the opinion of the Army, these forces are an adequate sup- 
plement to the National Guard. The Commission concurs. 
Planning 

For some years, ^the Army has conducted the military plan- 
ning and coordination necessary to control civil disorders, in- 
cluding the preparation of a family of plans which have been 
coordinated with appropriate headquarters and agencies. It is 
continuing this work to be certain that adequate federal units 
can be rapidly and effectively deployed and redeployed. 

The planning steps undertaken by the Army appear sufficient 
for the effective deployment of active Army troops to the scene 
of a disorder. 

The Commission believes it imperative that Army plans be 
fully coordinated with those of state and local governments. In 
particular, the Commission recommends that the Department 
of Justice, in cooperation with the Department of the Army, in- 
form state and local officials and National Guard officers of 
the exact procedures that must be used to obtain federal troops, 
the number of federal troops that would be available, the re- 
sponse times for such troops, and the relationships to be estab- 
lished among federal, state, and the local forces, particularly in 
the matter of command responsibilities. 

The Commission further recommends that federal-state plan- 
ning should ensure that federal troops are prepared to provide 
aid to cities not presently covered by the Army's "planning 
packet" effort. 

Training 

The effectiveness of the active Army units committed in De- 
troit was due in large part to the broad spectrum of training 
at individual and unit levels. Basic training produces well-con- 
ditioned and disciplined soldiers. Unit training molds them into 
teams and units, and develops further proficiency. Operational 
training for contingency missions stresses tactical techniques, 
as well as technical support to sustain large numbers of men 
in the field on extended duties. In sum, Army training in its 

507 


totality produces the type of well-disciplined and self-support- 
ing force essential for the control of a major disorder. 

Under present plans, units assigned to riot control contin- 
gency missions conduct specialized training in accordance with 
the doctrine and techniques set out in the Army Field Manual 
on "Civil Disturbances and Disasters." Special Army directives 
and the subject schedule recently prepared for National Guard 
units are also used to guide active Army training. Administra- 
tive and logistical units undergo specialized training in support 
of forces utilized for riot control. 

Because riot control duties are sometimes assigned to military 
police units, these units receive continual training in riot con- 
trol, including apprehension, detention, and crowd control 
measures. Selected Army officers and non-commissioned officers 
receive riot control training at the Military Police School. 

The Army is making an overall review of riot control train- 
ing, including expansion and revision of Field Manuals and 
subject schedules; an examination of the feasibility of integrat- 
ing National Guard and civilian authorities into command post 
and field training exercises; a revision of the course content of 
the Military Police School; an updating of riot control train- 
ing films by addition of recent film footage; a revision of equip- 
ment allowances for training; and distribution to various Army 
commands of lessons learned in recent disorders. 

The Commission commends the Army for the advanced status 
of its training, and for its current steps to strengthen that train- 
ing. As suggestions for further improvement, the Commission 

recommends: 

1. All officers and selected non-commissioned officers of Army 
units designated for use in civil disorders should receive ad- 
vanced command and staff training in riot control. 

2. Selected Military Police Corps officers should be given ad- 
ditional staff and command training in riot control and should 
be assigned as staff advisors to commanders of all Army units 
to be deployed to civil disorders. Training of such officers should 
include emphasis on close coordination with police departments 
in the major cities in the areas to which units are assigned. 
The training should familiarize them with the plans and 
operational procedures, as well as the command personnel, of 
these departments. 

3. The Army should investigate the possibility of utilizing 
psychological techniques to ventilate hostility and lessen ten- 
sion in riot control, and incorporate feasible techniques into 
training for Army and National Guard units. The Hong Kong 
police department has successfully used a number of such tech- 
niques in controlling disorders. For example, when confronted 
by a mob of screaming rioters, a detachment of Hong Kong 
police used microphones and amplifiers to make louder and 
play back the mob noise on the mob itself. The noise confused 
and ultimately broke up the mob. The "singed chicken" episode 
described in the Profile in Chapter 1 of the Elizabeth, New 
Jersey disorder is an example — although not a planned one — 
of how humor can break tensions and dissipate a crowd. 

4. All pertinent information and recommendations resulting 
from the review of training matters should be made available 

508 


to the National Guard, and to public safety and other officials 
of states and local communities. 
Equipment and Logistical Support 

The equipment and supplies normally issued and stocked for 
Army units equip them basically to perform in a civil disorder 
operation. Moreover, special equipment for riot control opera- 
tions has been identified and will be made available to "appro- 
priate Army and National Guard units. 

In the section on the National Guard, the Commission makes 
recommendations regarding the equipment of National Guard 
units engaged in control operations. The Commission believes 
these recommendations are fully applicable to the Army. 

The Commission further recommends that: 

1. The Army should put particular emphasis on having avail- 
able adequate supplies of communication equipment that will 
permit effective communications with such National Guard 
units and state and local law enforcement agencies as may be 
involved in control operations. 

2. The Department of the Army should participate fully in 
efforts to develop non-lethal weapons and personal protective 
equipment appropriate for use in civil disorders. 

V. Coordinating The Control Response 

Prompt and efficient response to a civil disorder requires full 
cooperation and coordination of all groups, public and private, 
that may be involved in overall control activities; only proper 
planning can ensure this response. The degree of coordination 
necessary and obtainable will vary with the type of agency or 
group involved, particularly private groups, but a basic require- 
ment is an allocation of duties and responsibilities, plus an 
effective command structure. 

The necessary planning is both "vertical" and "horizontal" 
in nature. Horizontal planning involves coordination among 
government agencies and private groups within a city or com- 
munity (intracity planning); among neighboring jurisdictions, 
including city and counties (intercity planning) ; and among 
states (interstate planning). Vertical planning involves coordi- 
nation at the state-local and federal-state levels. The primary 
responsibility for coordinated planning rests with state and 
local government. 

This portion of the Report considers areas where coordinated 
planning is necessary, and suggests guidelines for solutions. 
Horizontal Coordination and Planning * 

Intracity Coordinated Planning — For effective control of civil 
disorder, planning must include at least the basic city agencies 
(police, £re, courts) involved in control activities. Enlightened 
planning will also use the personnel and resources of all govern- 
ment agencies, together with groups of private citizens, that 
may be helpful in restoring and maintaining order. 

1. Government  Agencies  and  Private  Groups — Commission 

*For this portion of the report the Commission has relied heavily on a 
study prepared tor the Commission by the Public Administration Service of 
Chicago, Illinois, and on data provided by a survey of police departments 
done for the Commission by the International Association of Chiefs of Police. 

509 


studies reveal that most of the police departments surveyed 
have made some arrangements with other government agencies 
for a working relationship during a period of civil disorder. 
Nearly all of the departments have made arrangements with 
fire departments. Fewer, but still a clear majority, have made 
agreements with public transportation agencies; courts, deten- 
tion personnel, probation and parole officers; human relations 
commissions; and departments controlling streets, lights, signs 
and signals. Although these percentages indicate a degree of 
planning by most cities, there is little excuse for lack of co- 
ordinated planning among these basic agencies in any city. 
More important, the true degree of coordination cannot be de- 
termined without evaluating the precise type of arrangements 
in use. Certain responses indicated "cooperative" arrangements; 
but to be effective, planning must involve firm coordination, 
not merely vague cooperation. 

Our survey indicates that cities and police departments have 
not planned to make full use of the resources of various pri- 
vate groups and agencies that can contribute to both preven- 
tion and control of disorders. Of the 26 police departments re- 
porting information in this area, 11 plan to use church groups, 
seven plan to use youth service agencies or groups, ten have 
arrangements to obtain food and shelter from private sources, 
three plan to use personnel resources of watch services and 
private guard services, 12 plan to utilize the services of social 
service agencies, and 15 contemplate the use of personnel re- 
sources of police-community relations councils. 

The Commission recommends that all cities that have not al- 
ready done so should devise plans that coordinate all govern- 
ment agencies involved in control activities. It is the respon- 
sibility of mayors and other elected officials to assume the in- 
itiative in instituting such planning, and carrying it to a sat- 
isfactory conclusion. 

Such plans should also include to the fullest extent possible 
all private groups and agencies that may be directly affected by 
the disorder, or that can make a positive contribution to con- 
trol. Naturally, such planning will be less formal, and it should 
be sufficiently flexible to adapt to changing leadership of these 
groups. 

The government agencies and private groups to be covered 
by the planning include: police departments (including police- 
community relations units), fire departments, ambulance serv- 
ices, detention facilities, courts, legal aid services, probation and 
parole services, city or county human relations commissions, 
public and private transportation systems, public and private 
utilities, public health departments, hospitals, sanitation de- 
partments, telephone companies, news media, municipal works, 
civil defense agencies, private guard services, youth service 
groups, service agencies, churches, social workers, community 
action agencies, poverty program workers, and others. 

Coordinated planning should take into account the organiza- 
tion, manpower, and resources made available to state and local 
government for civil defense purposes under the Federal Civil 
Defense Act of 1950. Those resources include: emergency con- 
trol centers, communications equipment, emergency power 
sources, special rescue equipment, and various trained reserve 

510 


personnel. The Office of Civil Defense (OCD) reports that 
more than 184,000 volunteer reserve police, 172,000 reserve fire- 
men, and 176,000 rescue personnel have been trained through 
the civil defense program. Furthermore, at least 2,076 politi- 
cal jurisdictions have established emergency operating cen- 
ters, with an additional 547 in the process of construction or 
completion. 

Although the federal government provides equipment and 
funds to develop these resources, they belong to the states and 
local jurisdictions. They must be integrated into planning on a 
state or local level. 

Office of Civil Defense regulations authorize state and local 
governments to use such resources in time of an emergency 
whether caused by attack, a natural disaster, or a civil disorder. 
However, because of the need for police forces specially trained 
for riot control operations, local officials should carefully evalu- 
ate the state of training of any civil-defense trained personnel 
to be used as police. If such training is inadequate for actual 
control operations, the men could be assigned to guard vital 
installations, or other positions, in order to release active-duty 
police for control operations. 

In the past, it has not been clear whether equipment marked 
with civil defense insignia is available for use during a civil dis- 
order. The Commission understands that the OCD is reviewing 
its regulations, and if necessary will revise them to ensure that 
this equipment will be fully available. We recommend that the 
OCD ensure that the applicable rules and regulations are dis- 
seminated to all responsible state and local officials. 

The Commission further recommends that not only should 
all concerned agencies and groups be integrated into disorder 
control plans, but they should be involved also to the fullest 
extent possible in the planning process itself. As Brigadier Gen- 
eral Harris W. Hollis, Director of Operations, Office of the Deputy 
Chief of Staff for Military Operations, testified: 

The very process of involving all responsible officials in 
this planning process creates an awareness of common 
problems, and assures that principal officials will know 
their counterparts in other Government agencies and 
permits major policy questions to be addressed and re- 
solved without the air of crisis which prevails after a 
riot breaks out. 

Effective control operations require a specific and well-defined 
chain of command. Planning must clearly set out this command 
structure, and provide adequate mechanism for communication 
of orders. In accordance with traditional concepts of govern- 
ment, the mayor or other top city official must be in overall 
command. Because of the need for clear command authority, 
existing organizations and procedures of participating agencies 
should be reviewed to identify command weakness and to pin- 
point any defects in routine operations that could be disastrous 
during emergency conditions. 

All plans should be tested in training exercises. At a mini- 
mum, exercises should include checks of the command structure 
and communications. Finally, provision should be made to up- 

511 


date the plans periodically in order to take into account changed 
conditions, or to incorporate new control equipment and tech- 
niques into the procedures. 

After a plan has been formulated and implemented, steps must 
be taken to assure that all participating units are aware of their 
responsibilities under the plan. The plan should be set out in 
manual form and made available to all participating agencies. 
Except for strictly confidential portions, the plan should also 
be made public. The public has a right to know what to expect 
from government during a disorder — as well as what the gov- 
ernment expects from the public. 

Major or prolonged disorders may cause severe shortages of 
food, medical supplies, and even housing in the areas directly 
affected. Local and state planning must include means to supply 
on an emergency basis these basic human needs. 

2. Selected Community and Youth Groups — Two groups may 
be extremely useful in control activities, and in the prevention of 
civil disorders: 

a. Community groups already involved in government or po- 
lice department activities through various police-community re- 
lations programs, as for example, the police-community relations 
councils set up in many cities. 

The value of these groups was cited by one police chief who 
reported that during a disorder members of a neighborhood im- 
provement group that had previously been meeting with police- 
community relations people, took to the streets and successfully 
persuaded parents to keep youths off the streets and in their 
homes. Improper planning led to an instance where an agency 
issued passes to certain persons who were to attempt to "cool a 
situation" and who were themselves arrested by the police for 
apparent involvement in the disorder. 

All groups with the potential to help should be included in 
the planning process to ensure that their views and judgments 
are respected and used by the planning agencies to the fullest 
extent possible. They cannot be expected to participate effec- 
tively in control activities if they are called upon for help only 
after trouble has broken out. 

b. Youth groups.6 Evidence developed to date shows that 
youths are the main participants in a typical disorder, especially 
in the early stages, and are the principal source of "energy" for 
many of the disorders. In Detroit, for example, one survey 
shows that about 61 percent of the rioters were under 24 years 
of age. In the 1965 Watts riot, final records reveal that 45 per- 
cent of those arrested were under 25. 

Several cities have urged groups of Negro youths to assist 
police and others in the control of civil disorders. In Tampa, 
Florida, and Dayton, Ohio, they were called "White Hats." Their 
use has generated widespread publicity, as well as debate, on 
their effectiveness. 

The Tampa "White Hats" were organized during the Tampa 
disorder by three Negro adults, including the head of the Tampa 
Commission of Community Relations. The county sheriff gave 

5 In preparing this section, the Commission has relied upon a study of 
youth groups prepared for the Commission by the Administration of Justice 
Unit of the University Research Corporation. 

512 


the youths permission to patrol the riot area, and later furnished 
them with white helmets for identification. The youths, who 
were recruited from active participants in the riot, patrolled 
the riot area, particularly during a period when law enforcement 
officers were pulled out. This group has since been disbanded. 

In Dayton, Ohio, the "Youth-Dayton Police," also referred to 
as the "White Hat Patrol," was organized by a' Negro state 
legislator. Many of the youths involved had criminal records and, 
once again, were potential rioters. In the June 1967 disorder 
in Dayton, the White Hat Patrol helped persuade other youths 
to stop disorderly behavior, and was influential in getting them 
off the streets. 

There are, however, conflicting reports on the effectiveness of 
these groups. The Director of the Tampa Commission of Com- 
munity Relations, an organizer of the Tampa "White Hats," 
claims that they were very effective in restoring law and order 
in Tampa. Extensive publicity in national media echoed this 
assessment. On the other hand, certain police officials from 
other cities have minimized the importance of the Tampa "White 
Hats." They claim that the youths were used only after the dis- 
order had peaked and the riot was waning, or after police meas- 
ures had taken effect. The same officials have said they would 
be reluctant to utilize such groups, primarily because of the 
"vigilante" aspect of their activities. 

The Commission still lacks conclusive evidence on whether 
youth groups like the "White Hats" can be effectively utilized in 
all instances to help control disorders. Types of disorders and 
youths, as well as the quality of leadership, are hardly standard- 
ized. But the fact is they have been used with at least some 
degree of effectiveness. The Commission, therefore, recommends 
that intracity planning give attention to the possibility of using 
youth groups in control activities. This planning must be highly 
flexible to cope with the changing leadership of these groups. 

A delicate balance must be struck between working with and 
against youth groups; both courses carry implicit dangers. 
Working too closely with them can ultimately reduce their effec- 
tiveness since they may become too closely identified with the 
"establishment." But placing the "establishment" in direct op- 
position to them may itself contribute to a disorder, or, at least, 
galvanize hostility during a disorder. 

Intercity Planning — Control of a major civil disorder will gen- 
erally require resources beyond the capabilities of local govern- 
ment. One response to this problem is to seek state aid; the 
other is to obtain additional manpower, equipment and services 
from neighboring communities by means of preexisting plans or 
agreements, often referred to as mutual assistance pacts. We 
here explore the latter alternative. 

A variety of mutual assistance pacts are already in existence, 
primarily in the fields of fire protection, water supply and 
sewage disposal. The agreements range from the simple ex- 
change of information to elaborate procedures covering all mu- 
nicipal services. 

Mutual assistance agreements for police services in emergency 
situations are less common, and are generally on an informal 
basis. A study of 26 major police departments revealed that ten 

513 


had no written mutual aid agreements for control of civil dis- 
orders, 12 had informal agreements, and only four had formal 
agreements. Some departments also said they had made ar- 
rangements to "borrow" various items of equipment from neigh- 
boring jurisdictions. If these figures are typical of the entire 
country, it is plain that many cities are either overlooking or 
rejecting a potentially useful source of additional manpower 
and resources for the control of disorders. 

Mutual assistance pacts have these advantages over obtain- 
ing help from the state: help may arrive much more rapidly; 
repeated use of state police or National Guard forces may 
reduce or eliminate their "psychological" value; police officers ] 
from nearby communities may be more effective because they 
are familiar with local geographic and sociological patterns; 
agreements may lead to increased cooperation and coordination 
of activities in other fields; and the additional funds, person- 
nel and equipment for riot control can be utilized by local 
police departments in both emergency and ordinary operations, 
rather than diverting these resources to state forces established 
solely or primarily for the control of disorders. 

There are also certain disadvantages in mutual assistance 
agreements: riot control requires unit operations much like 
those used by the military, not the individual approach char- 
acteristic of normal police work; police-community relations 
may be so bad in an area that only outsiders, not neighbors, 
can cool the situation; National Guard units may have an im- 
portant psychological effect on rioters and may be more effective 
because of their training; police departments in adjoining corny 
munities may differ widely in quality of personnel, and the lower 
quality departments tend to dilute the effectiveness of the better 
ones; in times of emergency, a police department in a neighbor- 
ing city not experiencing a disorder may be reluctant to release 
its forces because of the possibility the trouble may spread. 

Although the Commission lacks sufficient data to weigh these 
conflicting factors, we believe, for several reasons, that mutual 
assistance agreements frequently offer a useful alternative to 
state aid. First, leading police officials have recommended them, 
particularly for supplying "stop-gap" aid until needed state 
forces can be mobilized. Second, there is evidence that these 
agreements work. Even in the aftermath of a major disorder 
in a nearby city, a community with a police department of 60 
was able, through a mutual assistance agreement, to augment 
its own department and produce a total force of some 220 men 
drawn from the county and from 31 neighboring communities. 
Third, we believe basically that a community which dem- 
onstrates that it can maintain public order by means of its own 
resources, plus resources from neighboring communities, can 
in the long run more effectively earn the necessary respect 
from all elements of the community. 

Although local considerations are paramount in formulating 
mutual aid agreements, certain basic factors must be taken 
into account: 

Proper planning — Any effective response to a disorder demands 
full coordination and planning of all agencies that may be 
involved in control activities. In the preceding section of this 
report we outlined the necessary intra jurisdictional planning 

514 


and coordination to deal with civil disorders; the same factors 
must be considered in drafting intercity agreements. Without 
proper planning and objective evaluation of the community re- 
sources available, mutual agreements are largely worthless. 

Legal problems — Although we believe there are no insurmount- 
able legal problems for putting into effect mutual aid agree- 
ments (with the possible exception of "home rule" cities), state 
legislation may present unnecessary obstacles, for example, by 
restricting such agreements in adjoining communities. 

The Commission recommends that each state not only under- 
take a review of existing legislation regarding mutual aid agree- 
ments for emergency services but also provide any necessary leg- 
islation to permit these agreements to be fully implemented. 
Such legislation should assure that police officers serving in other 
jurisdictions have adequate authority to do their jobs and that 
police, firemen, and other government personnel are given pro- 
tection against damage suits, loss of personal pension rights, 
and loss of disability benefits. In accord with the Supreme Court 
case of Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U.S. 503 (1893) , intercity mu- 
tual aid agreements across state lines require only statutory 
authorization of both states; they do not require congressional 
approval. 

Financial arrangements — Since the control of civil disorders 
may be extremely expensive, mutual assistance agreements 
must provide for payment of costs in a manner that will en- 
courage rather than inhibit prompt and immediate response 
in time of emergency. Various methods of allocating costs in- 
clude: apportionment of the cost of control activities among 
participating jurisdictions by a formula based upon either the 
location of the disorder or the relative size of the contracting 
cities; each jurisdiction bearing its own cost, with the mutual 
advantages of the agreement considered adequate compensa- 
tion; or one jurisdiction offering its services to another jurisdic- 
tion on a free basis. 

Basic operating procedures — Any workable agreement must 
specifically delineate operational procedures, including: methods 
by which the agreement can be invoked or activated; command 
arrangements for integrating the services of the calling and 
responding forces; the conditions under which a jurisdiction 
may decline to respond to a request for assistance (e.g., if it has 
a major fire or disorder within its own borders) ; a method for 
terminating the agreement; supporting steps to be taken by par- 
ticipating jurisdictions as, e.g., imposition of curfews and ordi- 
nances in neighboring cities; a basis for allocating liability for 
compensation of injured personnel; arrangements for coopera- 
tive training in riot control techniques; and training in joint 
operations pursuant to the agreement. 

Whether or not adjoining jurisdictions implement formal mu- 
tual assistance agreements, they should, at the very minimum, 
coordinate operations in areas where there is adjoining or con- 
current law enforcement jurisdiction. Failure to do so may have 
tragic consequences as, for example, when the county police 
broke up a meeting for lack of a park permit — after a city police 
department had authorized a grievance meeting with rioters in 
a public park. 

State responsibility — Although responsibility for implemen- 

515 


tating intercity mutual aid pacts rests primarily with the cities 
involved, state government has a corresponding duty to aid the 
cities in formulating these agreements, and, furthermore, to 
integrate the agreements into state plans for controlling dis- 
orders. California, for example, has a master law enforcement 
mutual aid plan providing for extensive interjurisdictional sup- 
port during a natural disaster or riot. A community's request for 
help in controlling a disorder is first referred to the county. If 
the county is unable to supply the necessary resources, applica- 
tion is then made to a regional coordinator who draws manpower 
from local governments within a particular geographical area 
under his control. If this aid is still inadequate, a request is made 
to the director of the state disaster office who can then transfer 
to the riot area resources from any jurisdiction in the state. 

Other ways in which a state may promote intercity mutual 
aid agreements include: legislative reforms to remove legal 
impediments to mutual agreements; counseling local jurisdic- 
tions concerning such agreements; determining the appropriate 
role of state police or National Guard when mutual aid agree- 
ments are in force; and providing specialized resources and 
equipment to participating jurisdictions. 

Interstate Mutual Assistance Agreements — A major disturb- 
ance within a single city, or a series of disturbances in a number 
of cities, may require control resources beyond city and state 
capabilities. For example, the Watts riot in August 1965 required 
a commitment of over 13,400 National Guard troops, 62 percent 
of total strength; Newark needed over 4,000 National Guard 
troops, over 30 percent of total strength; in Detroit, 8,262 Na- 
tional Guardsmen, 85 percent of total strength, plus 2,137 Air 
National Guard troops, together with more than 4,500 federal 
troops were deployed or in reserve nearby. If simultaneous major 
disturbances had broken out elsewhere in these states, resources 
far beyond state capabilities would have been necessary. 

There are two major sources for additional aid: 

1. Federal forces, as in Detroit in July 1967, or 

2. State forces from adjoining or nearby states pursuant to 
interstate mutual assistance agreements. 

Interstate agreements for the commitment of National Guard 
forces of more than one state, besides requiring congressional 
approval, present delicate and complex problems of federal-state 
relations. Furthermore, utilization of federally financed and 
trained National Guard troops pursuant to such agreements also 
raises problems relating to the primary purpose and mission of 
the Guard. 

Policy arguments against the use of sufeh agreements focus 
on the established principle that military forces should not be 
used against civilian population except in circumstances of ex- 
treme necessity, and then only in the degree and for such dura- 
tion as may be necessary to restore order. The use of federal 
forces to assist a state in controlling a civil disorder is restricted 
by a system of checks and balances that divides both power and 
responsibility between an individual state and the federal gov- 
ernment. This carefully balanced allocation of functions pro- 
vides protection against premature or excessive use of military 
force to control civil disorder. 

516 


Under interstate agreements, a governor would be able to call 
upon one or mo.e other states for military assistance, and would 
thus be able to concentrate military power without the restraints 
impooea uy me iederai-state relationship, sucn power coulc* po- 
tentially lead to excessive or indiscriminate use of military force 
against the civilian population. 

On more practical grounds, we have already noted that the 
dual federal-state function and mission of the National Guard 
create difficulties in the use of the Guard for riot control pur- 
poses even within a single state. We also noted the difficulties 
and burdens imposed upon individual Guardsmen when one 
Guard unit is pressed into duty two or more times within a 
limited period of time. These difficulties would be greatly en- 
larged if Guard units were subjected to call-up in more than 
one state pursuant to interstate agreements. 

Furthermore, because special Army units are immediately 
available for riot control duty, and because the Army and Air 
Force can rapidly transport large number of troops, federal 
troops could be dispatched to the scene of disorder in consider- 
ably less time than would be required for mobilizing and deploy- 
ing Guard forces from adjoining or nearby states pursuant to 
interstate agreements. 

Finally, the discipline, military experience, and intensive train- 
ing received by active federal troops make them generally more 
effective than National Guard units in putting down violence 
with minimum force under the adverse conditions of working in 
a strange city and state. 

Interstate mutual assistance agreements for nonmilitary aid 
-—firemen and firefighting equipment, food, emergency equip- 
ment, medical supplies and services — would not be subjected to 
the difficulties summarized above, and could play a valuable role 
in augmenting state resources. 
Vertical Planning 

Coordinated State-Local Planning — We have previously noted 
that for most states the National Guard is the primary control 
force available to supplement police forces in a single city. Co- 
ordinated planning for state assistance must, therefore, center 
about the National Guard. To the extent that state police are 
available in sufficient numbers and with adequate training for 
control operations, planning should also encompass their use. 

Most of the police departments surveyed have some plan or 
arrangements for obtaining state help. The Department of the 
Army has also established liaison with the Adjutants General 
of all state National Guards in order to review or prepare riot 
control plans for major cities within each state, and to coordi- 
nate federal, state and local plans. The Commission commends 
these actions. It strongly recommends that the appropriate state 
civil officials, heads of the state police departments, and top local 
civil and police officials of these cities, be involved in the plan- 
ning process. State officials must also assume the responsibility 
for establishing liaison with local officials in any city within the 
state that may experience a disorder, in order to review or pre- 
pare riot control plans. 

The Commission cannot deal with all aspects of state-local 
planning, but if all participating agencies are involved in the 

517 


planning process, and if plans are tested in training exercises, 
most problem areas will be identified and suitable solutions 
found. However, evidence available to the Commission has 
demonstrated that three major problems must be resolved in 
order to formulate an effective state-local plan. These problems, 
and some suggested guidelines for solution, are as follows: 

(1) Authority to Request and Order Call-up of State 
Forces 

In the early stages of one of last summer's major disorders, 
the initial call for state police assistance came from an inspec- 
tor of the local police department and was uirectea to the head 
of the state police. However, under state law only the mayor 
could ask for and only the governor could provide this assistance. 
Time was lost because of the failure to use proper channels. 

Since most states have specific laws setting out who can call 
the National Guard or the state police, any plan must necessarily 
take into account the statutory procedures. Many states do not 
have laws specifying who has the authority to request state 
assistance, and some laws do not specify the conditions under 
which state assistance will be authorized, whether or not re- 
quested. These points should be covered in an effective plan, 
which should also provide for a proper delegation of authority 
if the primary official is unavailable. 

As with all aspects of planning, it is imperative that the pro- 
visions for requesting and ordering state assistance be made 
known to all officials, including operating levels. 

(2) Command and Communication Between State and Local 
Forces 

Although most police departments surveyed understood how 
to request National Guard help, the question of command, if the 
Guard or state police was called in, was largely unanswered. In 
some states, command responsibilities are spelled out in the 
state statutes; in others, it is left to agreements, formal or other- 
wise, or to executive directives. An effective state-local plan must 
specifically resolve this question. 

The Commission heard conflicting testimony from National 
Guard officers and police officials on which agency should be in 
command. It is unnecessary for the Commission to make recom- 
mendations on this point since a specific answer is less im- 
portant than making certain that the question is resolved, that 
it is resolved in advance of the emergency, and that to the 
fullest extent possible it is resolved in favor of a single com- 
mander. Adequate planning for coordinated acts, as well as 
physical proximity of command posts, should eliminate most 
command problems, regardless of who is in overall command. 
Such planning should also eliminate possibilities of different 
degrees of force by different law enforcement groups as, for 
example, when one group increases aggressive action while an- 
other is unloading weapons and attempting to reduce tensions. 

Commitment of National Guard troops as individuals or in 
pairs destroys the basic value of the Guard as a disciplined 
force to be deployed as units and in strength appropriate to the 
emergency. Merely adding Guardsmen to police patrols, as was 

518 


*d 


done in some cities that experienced disorders, is not effective, 
for the unit commander loses control and cannot readily as- 
semble his unit to respond in force. It may, however, be desirable 
to assign some police officers to National Guard units, to serve 
in a liaison role or to make any necessary arresio and write 
charges. Thus, regardless of overall command, any plan must 
ensure thai Guara units are utilized as such, ana unaer control 
of a Guard officer. 

Adequate command procedures require that the state and local 
forces be able to communicate with each other. Officials from 
two major cities pointed out the extreme dimculties encountered 
in communication between local police and National Guard. In 
one case, there was no direct communication between the Na- 
tional Guard troops on the street and the local police unless 
police officers were riding with the National Guard troops or 
utilizing the police walkie-talkie system. In the other instance, 
the state police radios were on a frequency different from that 
of the local police department and, according to one state of- 
ficial, the local police k'did many things" that the state did not 
know about until much later. 

Effective state-local planning must also take into account that 
state police and National Guard forces may be working with 
local agencies other than the police, particularly fire depart- 
ments. Adequate command provisions, including communica- 
tions, must take these additional agencies into account. More- 
over, state-local planning should not neglect other state re- 
sources, such as state community relations departments. 
(3) Training 

Planning is not enough; there must be some provision for test- 
ing any plan to discover weaknesses before a disorder, preferably 
by a command post exercise. 

Many police chiefs have also suggested that in order for state 
and local forces to coordinate their activities correctly, each 
must have full awareness of the organization, function, and 
capabilities of the other organizations. Both National Guard 
and police officials emphasize the desirability of joint training 
between National Guard troops and state and local law enforce- 
ment officers. The Commission recommends that each state 
thoroughly explore the possibility of undertaking such training, 
especially at the command level. These exercises not only en- 
hance the capabilities of both the National Guard and the local 
police, but also provide the necessary testing of state, local, and 
state-local planning. 

Federal- State Coordination — Article IV, Section 4 of the Con- 
stitution provides that the federal government shall protect 
each of the states against invasion, "and on the application of 
the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature 
cannot be convened) against domestic violence." To carry out 
this provision, as well as its authority with respect to the militia, 
the Congress in 1792 enacted the statutory provisions that now 
appear (with minor amendments) as Sections 331 and 334 of 
Title 10 of the United States Code. These sections authorize the 
President, after a request of a state and after issuing an ap- 
propriate proclamation, to use such of the federal armed forces 

519 


as he considers necessary to suppress insurrection or domestic 
violence in that state.0 

However, in accordance with both Constitutional policy and 
the legislative history of these statutes, no President since these 
provisions were first invoked in 1838 has ordered federal troops 
into action until: (1) the actual request for federal troops had 
been received from the state, and (2) it had become clear that 
the disorder was beyond the control capacities of state and 
local authorities. As a result, since 1932, federal troops have 
been dispatched at state request to quell domestic violence only 
in 1943 and 1967, both times in Detroit. The most recent ex- 
perience in Detroit demonstrated the kinds of problems which 
can develop in the call-up of federal troops to control civil dis- 
orders. 

We firmly believe that primary responsibility for the control 
of civil disorders rests with the cities and that the states should 
provide the necessary reserve manpower and resources. We 
recognize, however, that in some instances no state will have 
adequate manpower or resources to deal with a major disorder, 
or to deal with disorders in a number of cities. Because of the 
problems that would be created by use of interstate agreements, 
the federal government will be the only source of the necessary 
additional assistance. 

The adequacy of the existing statutory authority and adminis- 
trative mechanism for call-up of federal troops has been ques- 
tioned as a result of the Detroit experience. Of particular con- 
cern are the implications of the use of the word "insurrection" 
in Section 331, and the requirement that federal troops can be 
dispatched only if the violence cannot be brought under control 
by state and local resources. 

The word "insurrection" creates fears because of the pos- 
sibility of nullifying insurance policies which generally do not 
protect against damages caused by insurrection. However, the 
Constitution speaks only of "domestic violence" and "insur- 
rection" and federal troops have been dispatched at state 
request in various situations other than political uprisings. As 
a result, existing instructions to states for obtaining federal 
troops require only a request based upon the existence of "seri- 
ous domestic violence." 

The second point — requiring exhaustion of state resources — 
presents a more serious question since it limits use of federal 
troops to the most extreme situations. Here the requirement 
is based not upon specific Constitutional or statutory language, 
but instead upon Constitutional policy, legislative history, and 
precedent established by a number of Presidents. Some claim 
this requirement should and could be eased by amendment of 
Section 331. Others point to the wisdom of severe restrictions on 

6 Sections 332 and 333 of Title 10, U.S. Code, provide for use of federal 
troops to deal with violence, or the threat of violence, which primarily 
obstructs enforcement of federal laws, or infringes on rights secured by the 
Constitution. Examples of such use include the Whiskey Rebellion in Wash- 
ington's time, nullification and secession before the Civil War, opposition to 
Reconstruction acts after the Civil War and, in the past decade, defiance of 
federal court orders in civil rights matters (e.g. Little Rock, Ark., in 1957 
and Oxford, Miss., in 1962). In instances of this sort, initiative for use of 
federal troops rests with the President rather than with a state governor. 

520 


use of federal military forces against civilians, a concept that is 
inherent in the Constitutional separation of power and re- 
sponsibility between the states and the federal government. 

Although we express no opinion on the Constitutional aspects 
of the latter argument, we are in accord that it represents 
sound policy, and believe that the existing conditions for ob- 
taining such help should be retained. We suggest, however, that 
in determining whether to commit federal forces, the state of 
preparedness, training and availability of the state's National 
Guard troops be taken into consideration. 

Although we agree with the policy underlying the use of 
troops pursuant to Section 331, we suggest that the Section be 
amended to update it and ensure that the language reflects 
existing Presidential precedents.7 The amendments should: 

(a) Change the word "insurrection" to "domestic violence" to 
eliminate any possible difficulties. 

(b) Make clear that the President will honor a request from 
a governor, not only when the State Legislature cannot be con- 
vened, but also when the Legislature cannot act in time to meet 
an emergency situation. 

(c) Make clear that the President will honor a request from 
a governor only when the state is unable to control the violence 
with its own resources, including its own National Guard. 

(d) Correct the apparently unintended restriction that only 
the National Guard of "other States," not the state requesting 
help, can be called into federal service. 

(e) Generally modernize the language — e.g., change "militia" 
to "National Guard." 

Certain difficulties in obtaining federal troops can be amelio- 
rated if state and local officials are fully aware of the means 
by which federal assistance may be granted, and the conditions 
that must be met. To this end, Attorney General Ramsey Clark 
wrote the governor of each state, in August 1967, and outlined 
the legal requirements for using federal troops to quell domestic 
violence, and the means by which federal assistance can be 
obtained. (Copy annexed as Exhibit A to this Supplement). 
To avoid any possible misunderstanding on the use of federal 
troops, the Commission recommends that each state take the 
appropriate steps to have the information in this letter dis- 
seminated to all state and local officials, to the Adjutant Gen- 
eral for dissemination to the National Guard, and to all heads 
of local law enforcement agencies. 

Conclusion 

The fully coordinated planning recommended in this portion 
of the report will require the time, effort, and active support 
of government officials and community leaders. It would be 
tragic indeed if this time and effort were expended solely in 
planning for a para-military response to civil disorders. 

The Commission, therefore, recommends that the government 
and community leaders involved in the planning should use 
the planning process as an opportunity to deal with other vital 
problems to assure that the resulting plans can serve additional

valuable purposes. The same planning and resources needed to 
control a serious civil disorder are also essentially applicable 
to any major local disaster or emergency which requires a total 
community effort as well as outside help. Such emergencies and 
disasters include, for example, floods, hurricanes, explosions 
and major fires. Even for individual agencies, portions of the 
civil disorder control plans can often prove useful in dealing 
with a variety of common and recurring problems. For example, 
local police departments, plus state police, are often required 
to work together and coordinate operations in order to control 
and regulate large groups of people who assemble for parades, 
visiting dignitaries, and sporting events. If these other pur- 
poses and uses are considered and acted upon during the plan- 
ning process, the resulting plans will have utility far beyond 
riot control. 

More important, the efforts spent in planning for control of 
disorders provide government and community leaders an im- 
portant starting point for efforts toward the only ultimate and 
responsible solution to the problem of civil disorder: a fully 
coordinated government and private attack on the conditions 
that give rise to the disorders. 

VI. Legal Needs For Riot Control8 

We emphasize that law, no less than the desire for order, 
must provide the framework for all control efforts. 

Applicable laws relating to control efforts of federal, state and 
local governments fall into two general categories: (1) laws per- 
manently in effect, primarily the penal laws of a state, supple- 
mented or augmented by municipal ordinances; and (2) special 
emergency laws put into effect only during a disorder as, for 
example, curfews, special emergency closing ordinances, and 
martial law. The Commission will also consider certain legal as- 
pects of the use of state forces to aid local police. 
Laws Permanently in Effect 

Many of the acts committed by rioters are crimes, in violation 
of long-established penal laws. In the disorders of last summer, 
arrests were made for crimes ranging from homicide to curfew 
violations, including, for example, robbery, burglary, assault, 
theft, arson and disturbing the peace. 

A Commission survey of selected police departments revealed 
no basic lack of legal tools available to control disorders. But 
the survey and other evidence have indicated five other areas 
where further legislation may be necessary. 

Laws governing the manufacture and possession of incendiary 
devices — Watts, Detroit, Newark and other major disorders have 
shown a disturbing increase in the possession and use by rioters 
of a variety of incendiary devices, primarily Molotov cocktails. 
Although the use of such a device is undoubtedly arson or at- 
tempted arson, some jurisdictions have no laws governing manu- 
facture or possession; others seek control through use of in- 
adequate fireworks ordinances. 

8 In preparing this section we have relied upon a study prepared for the 
Commission by the National League of Cities. 

522 


Forceful interference with the work of firemen and emergency 
workers— Firemen and emergency workers have been subjected 
to physical abuse, and harassed and interfered with in perform- 
ing their duties. Obviously, violence against any of these persons 
is a crime, but the experience of some riot-affected communities 
indicates that additional laws prohibiting forceful interference 
with the work of firemen and emergency workers may be neces- 
sary. 

Restrictions on the sale of firearms— The Crime Commission 
studied the relationship between violent crime and the easy 
availability of firearms in the United States. In its Report, the 
Commission pointed out that "During 1965, 5,600 murders, 34,700 
aggravated assaults and the vast majority of the 68,400 armed 
robberies were committed by means of firearms." The Crime 
Commission further stated that "All but ten of the 278 law en- 
forcement officers murdered during the period 1960-65 were 
killed with firearms." 

The Crime Commission surveyed existing federal, state and 
local gun control legislation and concluded: "Since laws, as they 
now stand, do not accomplish the purposes of firearms control, 
the Commission believes that all States and the Federal Govern- 
ment should act to strengthen them." The Commission recom- 
mended specific federal and state legislation reasonably regulat- 
ing the purchase, transportation, sale and possession of firearms. 

The fact that firearms can readily be acquired is an obviously 
dangerous factor in dealing with civil disorders. It makes it 
easier for a serious incident to spark a riot and may increase the 
level of violence during disorders. It increases the dangers faced 
by police and others seeking to control riots. 

We believe that all state and local governments should enact 
gun control legislation of the type recommended by the Crime 
Commission. 

We also believe that federal legislation is essential in order to 
make state and local laws fully effective, and to regulate areas 
beyond the reach of state government. We therefore support the 
President's call for gun control legislation and urge its prompt 
enactment. 

Restricting possibilities of theft of firearms — Certain recent 
disorders were accompanied by a drastic increase in the theft of 
firearms from stores and manufacturers. The most serious inci- 
dent reported took place in Plainfield, New Jersey, where, during 
the disorder, 46 carbines were stolen from a local manufacturer. 

The Commission recommends that state and local governments 
consider enactment of laws or ordinances controlling the storage 
of firearms and ammunition in order to diminish the possibilities 
of theft. Such laws could require, for example, that all firearms 
and ammunition be stored in heavily protected vaults or areas, 
or that essential parts of the firearms be so stored. 

Unlawful assembly, riot, inciting to riot and related legislation; 
federal anti-riot legislation — Forty-seven states and the District 
of Columbia have statutes that either explicitly prohibit par- 
ticipation in or incitement of riots or provide more general con- 
trol through prohibitions against unlawful assembly. Two other 
states rely on court decisions based on common law. 

523 


The Commission's police survey and other evidence disclosed 
that many of the statutes need review and revision. Some that 
deal with incitement to riot are so broad that they may im- 
properly inhibit the constitutional right of free speech/Some 
that provide no definition of "incitement" or comparable terms 
are dangerously vague. Those that define a riot in terms of 
groups containing as few as three persons may be applied in 
situations where nothing even approaching truly riotous activity 
is taking place. These statutes should be tightened. In addition, 
some older statutes require that police officers on the scene 
literally "read the riot act" before taking action against rioters. 
Such legislation should be amended to ensure adequate notice 
without unnecessarily inhibiting police action. 

A supplementary question is whether this network of state 
legislation should be supplemented by federal anti-riot legisla- 
tion. 

We recognize that criminal law enforcement is principally a 
matter of local responsibility and that crimes committed dur- 
ing disorders can generally be controlled and should be con- 
trolled at a local level. Moreover, the investigations of the Com- 
mission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have so far 
revealed no national planning or conspiracy behind the disorders 
of 1967 and few instances of interstate travel which would be 
subject to federal control. There is also a risk that too broad a 
bill would encroach on the right of free speech and peaceful as- 
sembly. 

Although no criminal legislation, federal or state, comes to 
grips with the underlying causes of disorder, the Commission 
feels that a tightly-drawn federal control statute might play a 
limited, but important, role in dealing with disorders. Even if 
there are only a few persons traveling with the intent of pre- 
cipitating disorders, these few can do enormous harm. 

Federal legislation, if enacted, should be precisely drafted, 
with a clear definition of all operative terms, so as to preserve 
scrupulously the constitutional rights of all Americans. Such 
legislation should be combined, as the President recommended, 
with the Federal Firearms Bill. Both are important means of re- 
stricting the interstate movement of forces of destruction. 

Whether or not legislation is enacted to deter those who would 
incite disorders, Congress should affirm now that violence is not 
to be tolerated in any sphere of our society. The prompt enact- 
ment of the civil rights legislation now pending — which would 
make it a federal criminal offense to use force to prevent the 
exercise of civil rights — is important for this purpose. This legis- 
lation is also central to the long-range goal of insuring that 
Americans in all parts of the country enjoy equal rights and op- 
portunities. 

Laws Applicable Only in Emergency Situations 

Effective control of a civil disorder may require special laws 
in addition to the normal complement of penal statutes and 
ordinances. Such emergency laws range from street closings to, . 

524 


restrictions on sales of certain items. Laws of this sort have 
been used in practically every control operation. 

The Commission recognizes the utility and need for such laws, 
especially those which provide for a specific, limited response to 
a particular problem, rather than wide-ranging emergency pow- 
ers. The Commission cannot consider all such laws, nor can it 
consider the Constitutional restraints that may be involved in 
the application of particular laws, such as search and seizure in 
connection with curfew violations. It will instead point to a few 
instances where the need for special legislation is apparent. 

Restricting access to defined geographic areas — In the early 
stages of some disorders, failure to seal off some streets had 
tragic consequences. Unsuspecting motorists drove headlong in- 
to barrages of bricks, stones and bottles, cars were set afire, and 
occupants were beaten. 

Restrictions on access may also be necessary to keep vigilante 
groups outside the riot area. 

The Commission recommends legislation or ordinances to 
permit disorder areas to be sealed off immediately. Since speed 
may be necessary, the laws should provide that the authority 
can be delegated to operational levels. 

Restriction on sales of particular items — Of the 26 police de- 
partments responding to the portion of the survey concerning 
effectiveness of specified control techniques, all replied that 
closing stores selling firearms and ammunition was effective; 
25 replied that closing liquor stores and taverns was effective; 
and 22 favored restrictions on sale of gasoline. The Commission 
recommends that laws be enacted to permit closing of poten- 
tially dangerous businesses during riot situations. The authority 
to impose such restrictions would primarily rest with the mayor 
or city manager. Provisions should be made to ensure that, if 
necessary, similar restrictions can be imposed in adjoining 
jurisdictions. An ordinance restricting sale of ammunition in 
one city would have a little effect if the stores in an adjoining 
city, a block away, remain open. As with the imposition of 
other emergency measures, notice of these restrictions is of 
paramount importance, and notification procedures must be in- 
tegrated into any control plan. 

Curfews — The Commission police survey shows that 23 re- 
sponding departments favored imposing curfews. The Commis- 
sion recommends that states that have not already done so 
should provide explicit legislative means to enable mayors and 
other local officials to impose curfews. 

The size of the areas covered by curfew restrictions has 
varied greatly. Milwaukee imposed a citywide curfew restrict- 
ing all persons to their homes, closing all streets to vehicular 
and pedestrian traffic, and permitting no one in or out of the 
city. Other curfew areas have been less restrictive in time and 
area. Unless care is used, the curfew itself may enable criminal 
elements to "close down a town" with minimum effort. 

In drafting curfew legislation there are at least two poten- 
tial problems: (a) the need for provisions which enable curfews 
to be imposed in adjoining cities in order to ensure coverage 
of the entire disorder area; (b) the need to ensure that notice 
of the curfew is given to all who may be affected by its terms. 

525 


Legal Problems Concerning Use of State Forces 

The relationship among the National Guard, state police, and 
local police in joint activities has been considered in the por- 
tions of the Report concerning the National Guard and state- 
local planning. Although these questions relate primarily to 
planning, certain legal problems require attention by state and 
local governments. 

Command and call-up procedures for state and National 
Guard forces — Most states have laws identifying the state or 
local officials who have the authority to call-up the National 
Guard; usually only the governor has this authority, but in 
some states even a local sheriff may call in the Guard to aid 
local law enforcement. However, only 20 states have laws speci- 
fying the relationship between National Guard forces and the 
civil police. In other states, the crucial command problem is 
left to agreements or executive directives. 

Although problems of call-up authority and command au- 
thority can in part be resolved by proper planning, the Com- 
mission recommends that each state review its laws concerning 
Guard call-up and command, and make any necessary changes 
to facilitate adequate planning. 

Arrest powers of state police and National Guard forces — In 
the absence of martial law, only seven states have laws granting 
National Guard troops the arrest powers of peace officers. This 
lack of authority is not important if police officers have been 
designated to accompany Guard troops when arrests are to be 
made. The problem should be reviewed in the planning process, 
and, if arrest authority is given to National Guard troops, ap- 
propriate guidelines for the use of such authority must also be 
provided. 

Responsibility for payment of the cost of using National Guard 
forces — Use of National Guard forces to quell a civil disorder 
may be costly. Whether the state or the local community must 
bear these costs is a serious policy question. 

On one hand, prevention and control of a civil disorder is part 
of the local responsibility to ensure civil peace. If the state is 
to bear the cost of Guard forces, a local community may limit 
its efforts to prevent disorders (or its efforts to provide adequate 
control in the early stages) and rely instead on calling the Guard 
whenever there is danger that an incident may develop into a 
disorder. This attitude may also contribute to the dangers of 
overreaction. 

If costs of using the National Guard are to be assessed against 
a local community, the mayor or other local officials may un- 
necessarily delay calling in the Guard. 

The Commission recommends that all states consider this 
problem in advance and pass necessary legislation providing 
either for the assessment of costs of National Guard forces, or 
otherwise ensuring that the problem is resolved by agreement 
between the states and local communities. 

Liability of Guard officers and men when aiding local law en- 
forcement— Questions have been raised regarding the legal lia- 
bility of Guardsmen when assisting local law enforcement of- 

526 


ficers to control a disorder. The Commission recommends that 
each state review its laws on this subject, and make any neces- 
sary changes to ensure that individual Guardsmen are protected 
against legal liability when acting pursuant to the valid orders 
of their superiors. 

Compilation and Distribution of Laws Relating to Disorders 

The people have a right to know precisely what the law re- 
quires of them during a disorder, and an equal right to know 
the legal limits of control activities by law enforcement officers. 
Certain cities, counties, and states have already prepared book- 
lets containing this information, have distributed these booklets 
to all police departments and other law enforcement agencies, 
and have made the booklets available to the public at large. We 
recommend adoption of such a policy.

OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
Washington, D.C. 20530 


Exhibit A: Letter from the Attorney General 
to the Governors, August 7, 1967 

Dear Governor: 

At the President's request, I am writing you regarding 
the legal requirements for the use of Federal troops in case 
of severe domestic violence within your state. The requirements 
are simple. They arise from the Constitution. So the principles 
will be clearly in mind, I will briefly outline here the basic 
considerations of Federal law applicable to such a situation* 

The underlying constitutional authority is the duty of 
the United States under Article IV, Sec. 4, to protect each of 
the states "on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive 
(when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic 
Violence." This pledge is implemented by Chapter 15 of Title 
10, U.S.C. and particularly 10 U.S.C. 331, which derives from 
an act of Congress passed in 1792. The history of the use of 
Federal forces at the request of governors in varied circum- 
stances of local violence over more than a century is also 
instructive. 

There are three basic prerequisites to the use of Federal 
troops in a state in the event of domestic violence: 

(1) That a situation of serious "domestic Violence" exists 
within the state. While this conclusion should be supported with 
a statement of factual details to the extent feasible under the 
circumstances, there is no prescribed wording. 

(2) That such violence cannot be brought under control by 
the law enforcement resources available to the governor, 
including local and State police forces and the National 
Guard. The judgment required here is that there is a definite 
need for the assistance of Federal troops, taking into account the 
remaining time needed to move them into action at the scene 
of violence. 

(3) That the legislature or the governor requests the President 
to employ the armed forces to bring the violence under 
control. The element of request by the governor of a State 

is essential if the legislature cannot be convened. It may be 
difficult in the context of urban rioting, such as we have 
seen this summer, to convene the legislature. 

These three elements should be expressed in a written 
communication to the President, which of course may be a 
telegram, to support his issuance of a proclamation under 
10 U. S. C. 334 and commitment of troops to action. In case of 
extreme emergency, receipt of a written request will not be a 

528 


prerequisite to Presidential action. However, since it takes 
several hours to alert and move Federal troops, the few 
minutes needed to write and dispatch a telegram are not 
likely to cause any delay. 

Upon receiving the request from a governor, the President, 
under the terms of the statute and the historic practice, must 
exercise his own judgment as to whether Federal troops will 
be sent, and as to such questions as timing, size of the force, 
and federalization of the National Guard. 

Preliminary steps, such as alerting the troops, can be 
taken by the Federal government upon oral communications and 
prior to the governor's determination that the violence cannot 
be brought under control without the aid of Federal forces. 
Even such preliminary steps, however, represent a most serious 
departure from our traditions of local responsibility for law 
enforcement. They should not be requested until there is a 
substantial likelihood that the Federal forces will be needed. 

While the formal request must be addressed to the President, 
all preliminary communications should be with me. When 
advised by you that serious domestic violence is occurring, I will 
inform the President and alert the proper military authorities. 
You can reach me at my office, my home, or through the 
White House switchboard at any hour. 

Enclosed are copies of the relevant constitutional and 
statutory provisions and a brief summary of past occasions 
on which a governor has requested Federal military assistance. 
Your legal counsel, I am sure, keeps you fully advised of 
requirements of state law as well. 

If you have any questions or comments, please let me know. 
Sincerely, 

(signed) Ramsey Clark 

Attorney General

STATE REQUESTS FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE 

IN  SUPPRESSING  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE 

A Chronological List 

1838 — Buckshot War. The Pennsylvania Governor asked for Fed- 
eral assistance (based on Const. Art. IV, sec. 4) in restor- 
ing order when violence resulted from a bitter political 
contest. President Van Buren refused on the ground that 
Federal interference is justified only where domestic 
violence is such that State authorities have proved in- 
adequate. 

1842 — Dorr Rebellion. Rhode Island Governor King asked for 
assistance to stop the attempt of Dorr to claim the Gov- 
ernorship. President Tyler replied that the time for 
Federal interference had not arrived since there was no 
actual insurrection. Further requests were denied on the 
ground that the legislature was in session and the Gov- 
ernor therefore was not authorized to apply for aid. The 
President said he would issue a proclamation if a lawful 
request was made, but Dorr disbursed his troops and this 
was not done. 

1856 — San Francisco Vigilance Committee. California Governor 
requested Federal aid in stopping the Committee from 
usurping the authority of the State. The Attorney General 
advised President Pierce that the circumstances did not 
afford sufficient legal justification for Federal assistance 
since there was no "actual shock of arms" between insur- 
gents and the State, and the State had not exhausted its 
powers to deal with the situation. (8 Op. A. G. 8). The 
President took no action. 

1873 — New Orleans unrest — Lawlessness due to racial problems 
and also political uncertainty as to proper occupants of 
political office resulted in violence. Louisiana Governor 
asked for Federal help. President Grant issued a procla- 
mation ordering the insurgents to disperse. Failure to heed 
the proclamation and increased disturbance resulted in a 
further proclamation and dispatch of two regiments. 

1876 — South Carolina riots. Riots resulted from an altercation 
between the Ku Klux Klan and Negro state militia. The 
President issued a proclamation in response to a call for 
Federal intervention and troops were stationed at 70 
places in the State to secure the peace during the election. 
(This action culminated in enactment of Posse Comitatus 
Act of 1878.) 

1877 — Railroad Strike riots. Upon request for Federal interven- 
tion, President Hayes issued proclamations with respect to 
West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Illinois to 
restore order. The Ohio Governor asked for and received 
Federal arms but did not request troops. Indiana asked 
the President to authorize the commandant at the U.S. 
531 


arsenal to aid the state. On the ground that the request 
was incorrectly made, the Governor was informed that 
Federal troops would be used only to protect U.S. property. 
Michigan, Wisconsin and California also made requests 
for help but the situation in those states did not become 
critical. 

1892 — Idaho's Coeur D'Alene mining disturbances. During a 
seven year period, Presidents Harrison, Cleveland and Mc- 
Kinley furnished Federal assistance which was requested 
by Idaho Governors. 

1894 — Coxey's Army of unemployed. President Cleveland in- 
structed the army to assist Montana in handling violence 
of a Coxeyite contingent in Montana, at the Governor's 
request. However, the President did not issue a formal 
proclamation. 

1903 — Colorado mining strike disturbance. President Theodore 
Roosevelt denied assistance to the Colorado Governor who 
made two requests for "such aid as I may call for," but 
promised that the Federal Government would act when a 
request was made in a manner "contemplated by law," 
explaining that under H.R. 5297 there must be shown an 
insurrection against the State and inability of the State to 
control it. 

1907 — Nevada mining disturbance. In response to an urgent re- 
quest from the Governor, President Roosevelt ordered 
troops to assist. Later, a President's investigating commit- 
tee found there was no warrant for the assertion that the 
civil authority of the state had collapsed. After the Presi- 
dent threatened withdrawal of the troops, the Governor 
convened the legislature, which asked that Federal troops 
remain for a short period until the State Police could be 
organized and equipped to handle the situation. 

1914 — Colorado coal strike. At the request of the Governor, Pres- 
ident Wilson sent troops to stop rioting, but only after 
considerable negotiation and exploring of avenues of 
peaceful resolution by Government representatives failed. 

1919 — Race riots in Washington, D.C. and Omaha; Gary steel 
strike. On the theory that the service by the National 
Guard in the war left the States without adequate protec- 
tion against internal disorders, the Secretary of War 
instructed commanders of the departments to respond to 
state requests for assistance. The use of Federal troops in 
1919 was without a proclamation or other formalities. 

1921 — West Virginia coal mine warfare. President Harding was 
requested by the Governor to intervene. The President 
stated that he was not justified in using Federal military 
forces until he was assured the State had exhausted all its 
resources. A subsequent outburst of violence resulted in a 
Proclamation and order to dispatch Federal troops. The 
troops met no resistance and disarmed the miners. 

1932 — The Bonus Army. Needy veterans who came to Washington 
to seek veterans' bonus legislation were housed in tents, 
shacks, and government buildings which were being de- 
molished. The Treasury Department attempted to repos- 
sess a government building in order to continue demolition, 

532 


resulting in a clash between the veterans and police. The 
District Commissioners asked the President for assistance 
and the army moved in, cleared the buildings and de- 
stroyed the shacks. No proclamation was issued. 

1943 — Detroit race riots. The Governor advised that the State 
was unable to suppress domestic violence, the President 
issued a proclamation and Federal troops were dispatched. 

1967 — Detroit riots. The most recent incident, of course, was the 
dispatch of Federal troops to Detroit on July 24, 1967 at 
the request of the Governor. President Johnson issued a 
proclamation and Executive order pursuant to Chapter 15 
of Title 10, U.S. Code.

Appendix B : Remarks of the President 

Upon Issuing an Executive Order 

Establishing a National Advisory 

Commission on Civil Disorders, July 29, 1967 

This morning I have welcomed the members of the Commis- 
sion on Civil Disorders to the White House for its first meeting. 
The Commission is chaired by Governor Kerner of Illinois. The 
Vice Chairman is Mayor Lindsay of New York. They are both 
here with me. 

I have commended these 11 citizens for what they have agreed 
to do for this Nation. They are undertaking a responsibility as 
great as any in our society. 

The civil peace has been shattered in a number of cities. The 
American people are deeply disturbed. They are baffled and dis- 
mayed by the wholesale looting and violence that has occurred 
both in small towns and great metropolitan centers. 

No society can tolerate massive violence, any more than a 
body can tolerate massive disease. And we in America shall not 
tolerate it. 

But just saying that does not solve the problem. We need to 
know the answers, I think, to three basic questions about these 
riots: 

— What happened? 

— Why did it happen? 

— What can be done to prevent it from happening again and 
again? N 

Beyond these basic questions there are others — the answers 
to which can help our Governors and our mayors, our chiefs of 
police and our citizens all over the country to cope with their 
immediate and their long-range problems of maintaining order: 

— Why riots occur in some cities and do not occur in others? 

— Why one man breaks the law, while another, living in the 
same circumstances, does not? 

— To what extent, if any, there has been planning and organ- 
ization in any of the riots? 

— Why have some riots been contained before they got out of 
hand and others have not? 

— How well equipped and trained are the local and State 
police, and the State guard units, to handle riots? 

— How do police-community relationships affect the likelihood 
of a riot — or the ability to keep one from spreading once it 
has started? 

— Who took part in the riots? What about their age, their 
level of education, their job history, their origins, and their 
roots in the community? 

— Who suffered most at the hands of the rioters? 

— What can be done to help innocent people and vital insti- 
tutions escape serious injury? 

— How can groups of lawful citizens be encouraged, groups 
that can help to cool the situation? 

536 


— What is the relative impact of the depressed conditions in 
the ghetto — joblessness, family instability, poor education, 
lack of motivation, poor health care — in stimulating people 
to riot? 

— What Federal, State and local programs have been most 
helpful in relieving those depressed conditions? 

— What is the proper public role in helping cities repair the 
damage that has been done? 

— What effect do the mass media have on the riots? 

What we are really asking for is a profile of the riots — of the 
rioters, of their environment, of their victims, of their causes 
and effects. 

We are asking for advice on 

— short-term measures that can prevent riots, 

— better measures to contain riots once they begin, 

— and long-term measures that will make them only a sordid 
page in our history. 

I know this is a tall order. 

One thing should be absolutely clear: this matter is far, far 
too important for politics. It goes to the health and safety of all 
American citizens — Republicans and Democrats. It goes to the 
proper responsibilities of officials in both of our Parties. It goes 
to the heart of our society in a time of swift change and of great 
stress. I think the composition of this Commission is proof 
against any narrowness or partisanship. 

You will have all the support and cooperation you need from 
the Federal government, as the Chairman and the Vice Chair- 
man lead this Commission in this study. 

Sometimes various Administrations have set up commissions 
that were expected to put the stamp of approval on what the 
Administration believed. 

This is not such a commission. We are looking to you, not to 
approve our own notions, but to guide us and to guide the coun- 
try through a thicket of tension, conflicting evidence and ex- 
treme opinion. 

So, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Vice Chairman, let your search be 
free. Let it be untrammeled by what has been called the "con- 
ventional wisdom." As best you can, find the truth, the whole 
truth, and express it in your report. 

I hope you will be inspired by a sense of urgency but also con- 
scious of the danger that lies always in hasty conclusions. 

The work that you do ought to help guide us not just this 
summer, but for many summers to come and for many years to 
come. 

Thank you.

Appendix C: Excerpts from President Lyndon B. John- 
son's Address to the Nation on Civil Disorders, 
July  27, 1967 


My fellow Americans: 

We have endured a week such as no Nation should live 
through: a time of violence and tragedy. 

For a few minutes tonight, I want to talk about that tragedy 
— and I want to talk about the deeper questions it raises for us 
all. 

I am tonight appointing a special Advisory Commission on 
Civil Disorders. 

Governor Otto Kerner, of Illinois, has agreed to serve as 
Chairman, Mayor John Lindsay, of New York, will serve as Vice 
Chairman. Fred R. Harris, Senator from Oklahoma; Edward 
W. Brooke, United States Senator from Massachusetts; James 
C. Corman, U. S. Representative from California, 22nd District, 
Los Angeles; William M. McCulloch, the U. S. Representative 
from the State of Ohio, the 4th District; I. W. Abel, the Presi- 
dent of the United Steel Workers; Charles B. Thornton, 
the President, Director and Chairman of the Board of Litton 
Industries, Inc.; Roy Wilkins, the Executive Director of the 
NAACP; Katherine Graham Peden, the Commissioner of Com- 
merce of the State of Kentucky; Herbert Jenkins, the Chief of 
Police, Atlanta, Georgia. 

The Commission will investigate the origins of the recent dis- 
orders in our cities. It will make recommendations — to me, to 
the Congress, to the State Governors, and to the Mayors — for 
measures to prevent or contain suqh disasters in the future. 

In their work, the Commission members will have access to 
the facts that are gathered by Director Edgar Hoover and the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI will continue to exer- 
cise its full authority to investigate these riots, in accordance 
with my standing instructions, and continue to search for evi- 
dence of conspiracy. 

But even before the Commission begins its work; and even 
before all the evidence is in, there are some things that we can 
tell about the outbreaks of this summer. 

First — let there be no mistake about it — the looting, arson, 
plunder and pillage which have occurred are not part of a civil 
rights protest. There is no American right to loot stores, or to 
burn buildings, or to fire rifles from the rooftops. That is crime 
—and crime must be dealt with forcefully, and swiftly, and cer- 
tainly— under law. 

Innocent people, Negro and white, have been killed. Damage 
to  property — owned  by  Negroes  and  whites— is  calamitous. 

538 


Worst of all, fear and bitterness which have been loosed will 
take long months to erase. 

The criminals who committed these acts of violence against 
the people deserve to be punished— and they must be punished. 
Explanations may be offered, but nothing can excuse what they 
have done. 

There will be attempts to interpret the events of the past few 
days. But when violence strikes, then those in public responsi- 
bility have an immediate and a very different job: not to ana- 
lyze, but to end disorder. 

That they must seek to do with every means at their com- 
mand: through local police, state officials, and, — in extraordi- 
nary circumstances where local authorities have stated that 
they cannot maintain order with their own resources — then 
through Federal power that we have limited authority to use. 

I have directed the Secretary of Defense to issue new training 
standards for riot control procedures immediately to National 
Guard units across the country. Through the Continental Army 
Command, this expanded training will begin immediately. The 
National Guard must have the ability to respond effectively, 
quickly, and appropriately, in conditions of disorder and vio- 
lence. 

Those charged with the responsibility of law enforcement 
should, and must, be respected by all of our people. The violence 
must be stopped: quickly, finally, and permanently. 

It would compound the tragedy, however, if we should settle 
for order that is imposed by the muzzle of a gun. 

In America, we seek more than the uneasy calm of martial 
law. We seek peace based on one man's respect for another man 
— and upon mutual respect for law. We seek a public order that 
is built on steady progress in meeting the needs of all of our 
people. 

Not even the sternest police action, nor the most effective 
Federal Troops, can ever create lasting peace in our cities. 

The only genuine, long-range solution for what has happened 
lies in an attack— mounted at every level— upon the conditions 
that breed despair and violence. All of us know what those con- 
ditions are: ignorance, discrimination, slums, poverty, disease, 
not enough jobs. We should attack these conditions — not be- 
cause we are frightened by conflict, but because we are fired by 
conscience. We should attack them because there is simply no 
other way to achieve a decent and orderly society in America. 
• • • 

This is not a time for angry reaction. It is a time for action: 
starting with legislative action to improve the life in our cities. 
The strength and promise of the law are the surest remedies for 
tragedy in the street. 

But laws are only one answer. Another answer lies in the way 
our people will respond to these disturbances. 

There is a danger that the worst toll of this tragedy will be 
counted in the hearts of Americans; in hatred, in insecurity, in 
fear, in heated words which will not end the conflict, but pro- 
long it. 

So let us acknowledge the tragedy; but let us not exaggerate 
it. 

539 


Let us look about tonight. Let us look at ourselves. We will see 
these things: 

Most Americans, Negro and white, are leading decent, re- 
sponsible and productive lives. 

Most Americans, Negro and white, seek safety in their neigh- 
borhoods and harmony with their neighbors. 

Nothing can destroy good will more than a period of needless 
strife and suspicion between the races. 

Let us condemn the violent few. But let us remember that it is 
law-abiding Negro families who have really suffered most at the 
hands of the rioters. It is responsible Negro citizens who hope 
most fervently — and need most urgently — to share in America's 
growth and prosperity. 

This is not the time to turn away from that goal. 

To reach it will require more than laws; more than dollars. 
It will take renewed dedication and understanding in the heart 
of every citizen. 

I know there are millions of men and women tonight who are 
eager to heal the wounds that we have suffered; who want to 
get on with the job of teaching and working and building 
America. . . . 

... I call upon every American to search his own heart. 

To those who are tempted by violence, I would say this: 
Think again. Who is really the loser when violence comes? 
Whose neighborhood is made a shambles? Whose life is threat- 
ened most? 

If you choose to tear down what other hands have built, 

— You will not succeed; 

— You will suffer most from your own crimes; 

— You will learn that there are no victors in the aftermath of 
violence. 

The apostles of violence, with their ugly drumbeat of hatred, 
must know that they are now heading for disaster. And every 
man who really wants progress or justice or equality must stand 
against them and their miserable virus of hate. 

For other Americans, especially those in positions of public 
trust, I have this message: 

Yours is the duty to bring about a peaceful change in Amer- 
ica. If your response to these tragic events is only "business as 
usual" — you invite not only disaster, but dishonor. 

My fellow citizens, let us go about our work. Let us clear the 
streets of rubble and quench the fires that hatred set. Let us 
feed and care for those who have suffered at the rioter's hands 
— but let there be no bonus or reward or salutes for those who 
have inflicted that suffering. 

Let us resolve that this violence is going to stop and there will 
be no bonus to flow from it. We can stop it. We must stop it. 
We will stop it. 

And let us build something much more lasting: faith between 
man and man, faith between race and race. Faith in each other 
— and faith in the promise of beautiful America. 

Let us pray for the day when "mercy and truth are met to- 
gether; righteousness and peace have kissed each other." Let 
us pray— and let us work for better jobs and better housing and 

540 


better education that  so  many  millions of  our own fellow 
Americans need so much tonight. 

Let us then act in the Congress, in the city halls, and in every 
community, so that this great land of ours may truly be "one 
Nation under God— with liberty and justice for all."

Appendix H: Report To The Commission 

By The 

Advisory Panel on Private Enterprise, January 29, 1968 


At the request of the Commission, we have considered the 
appropriate role of the profit-making free enterprise system in 
helping to alleviate the causes of civil disorders, which are the 
subject of the Commission's work. In our meetings and delibera- 
tions during the past two months we have taken as our starting 
point the evidence presented to the Commission on the causes 
of the disorders and the alternative courses of action which 
might be pursued to deal with those causes. We have also sought 
the advice of representative members of the business community 
and others both within and outside of government. 

We conclude that maximum utilization of the tremendous 
capability of the American free enterprise system is a crucial 
element in any program for improving conditions, in both our 
urban centers and our rural poverty areas, which have brought 
us to the present crisis. 

The maintenance of public order is primarily the responsibility 
of the public sector, but the private sector is the mainspring of 
the national economy and consequently of the economic well- 
being of our citizens. Free enterprise, with its system of incen- 
tives and rewards for hard work, ability, ingenuity and crea- 
tivity, has made this nation strong and produced the highest 
standard of living the world has ever known. Under the spur of 
competition, the discipline of business management produces 
maximum benefit from the funds and other resources available. 

More than eighty-five percent of the current annual gross 
national product of over 800 billion dollars is attributable to the 
private business sector. Eighty-four percent of the nation's 73 
million civilian workers are employed by 11.5 million separate 
private, profit-making employers, of which more than 1.3 million 
are corporations. Even five percent of the total number of pri- 
vate employers would represent more than 500,000 enterprises. 
The involvement of even that number would constitute a mas- 
sive, pluralistic and truly national approach to the national 
problem of civil disorder and the closely related problem of 
chronic unemployment and underemployment, particularly 
among Negroes. 

For similar reasons the nation in the past has repeatedly relied 
upon the private sector to assist in solving complex national 
problems. In the field of defense, contracts <with private com- 
panies for materiel, supplies and services amounted to 34 billion 
dollars in fiscal year 1966. In the exploration of outer space, 
contracts of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
with private companies amounted to more than four billion 
dollars in fiscal year 1966. 

558 


The concept that the private sector must also be involved in 
overcoming the challenge of racial ghettos in urban areas and 
poverty in rural areas is now widely accepted, both within and 
outside the government. In his State of the Union Message on 
January 17, 1968, the President called for "a new partnership 
between government and private industry to train and to hire the 
hard-core unemployed persons." The Congress has made similar 
declarations in a number of acts, including the Economic Oppor- 
tunity Act, the basic charter of the War on Poverty. 

Dr. Kenneth B. Clark, the eminent Negro psychologist and 
educator who testified before the Commission, stated in a recent 
article in answer to the question "What role can business play 
in finding answers to rioting?": 

Business and industry are our last hope. They are the 
most realistic elements of our society. Other areas in our 
society — government, education, churches, labor— have 
defaulted in dealing with Negro problems. 

No fewer than thirty of the witnesses who have appeared before 
the Commission referred to a role for the private sector in 
meeting those urban problems which contribute to civil disorder. 

We believe that these widely -shared sentiments about the role 
of the business community are more than mere rhetoric. The 
private sector has shown its concern and capacity for making a 
contribution in the fields relevant to the urban crisis. In many 
cases it has done so in collaboration with government, and in 
many cases it has done so entirely independently of government. 
A partnership of profit-making businesses and local governments, 
organized labor, and religious groups has recently been organized 
in The Urban Coalition, and there are numerous examples of 
involvement by individual companies in useful projects of various 
types. 

Some of the areas in which there is evidence that the private 
sector could make a contribution are: 

Job Training and Employment: The on-the-job training pro- 
gram under the Manpower Development and Training Act of 
1962 has involved more than two thousand private employers. 
The Job Corps has involved more than 20 private companies as 
managers of urban training centers. Numerous similar under- 
takings by private companies have been catalogued by the 
National Association of Manufacturers as part of its STEP 
(Solutions to Employment Problems) program, a national clear- 
inghouse for such endeavors; and by the National Industrial 
Conference Board in the proceedings of its conference on "Cor- 
porate Urban Programs— An Investment in Economic Progress 
and Social Order," held on January 10, 1968, in New York City. 

Housing: Joint ventures with public housing authorities to 
reconstruct low-income apartments, housing development cor- 
porations to receive industrial and banking investments, and 
"instant renewal," utilizing prefabricated units, have been 
pioneered by a number of companies. 

Economic Development: A consortium of seven of the largest 
life insurance companies has been created to extend loans in 

559 


ghetto areas where investment risks were previously considered 
too great. Several companies have established plants in various 
poverty areas to employ and train local residents. "Operation 
Bootstrap," through tax and other incentives, has drawn some 600 
companies into investments in new plants in Puerto Rico since 
1942, has resulted in the rapid development of the Puerto Rican 
economy and a dramatic increase in the standard of living, and 
now serves as a model for the development of other areas of the 
Western Hemisphere. As a by-product, "Operation Bootstrap" 
has also reversed the net in-migration of Puerto Ricans to the 
continental United States, which was an in-migration from a 
rural poverty area to urban centers much like the massive out- 
flow of the rural poor to American cities in recent decades. 

Negro Entrepreneur ship: In order to support and develop 
needed managerial capabilities in the Negro community, a num- 
ber of small business programs have relied upon the private 
sector. The Small Business Administration made almost 3,500 
loans during fiscal year 1967 under its Economic Opportunity 
Loan Program, many in participation with private lending 
institutions and many as guarantor of private loans. A privately- 
sponsored non-profit group, the Interracial Council for Business 
Opportunities, has utilized volunteer executives of successful 
businesses to provide managerial assistance to small businesses. 
The ICBO has assisted approximately 1,000 businessmen since 
1963 and has created a private, bank-guaranteed loan fund. 
A Department of Commerce program has so far stimulated 
creation of four trade associations for counselling and other 
assistance to Negro small businessmen. Some companies have 
created private community development corporations which 
provide managerial assistance to Negro entrepreneurs. 

Education: A number of companies have provided basic literacy 
and mathematical skill training to their own disadvantaged 
employees and in some cases to those of other companies, under 
contract. A number of profit-making Job Corps contractors have 
pioneered rapid literacy techniques. 

Attitudinal Change: Inclusion of Negroes in national adver- 
tising has been spurred by the Advertising Council, and many 
companies are taking affirmative steps to improve the attitudes 
of their employees and customers through in-plant literature 
as well as through advertising policy. 

While business and industry are making substantial efforts in 
these and other fields, we believe that much more can and 
should be done. Many more companies will undoubtedly enter 
these fields on a volunteer basis, in some cases because they 
recognize that the price of inaction may well be continued ten- 
sion and disorder and the ultimate breakdown of the tranquility 
which underlies our entire social fabric and economic growth. 
And this process might, and should, be accelerated by exhorta- 
tion from government and business leadership. 

But we believe that a truly massive number of companies could 
be induced to participate only if appropriate monetary incentives 
are provided by the Federal government to defray the unusual 
costs of participation. We also believe that opportunities for 
business involvement, on a substantially broader scale than at 
present, exist primarily in the areas of employment and job 

560 


training and in economic development, in the sense of the estab- 
lishment of plants and other facilities in poverty areas, both 
urban and rural. Housing, Negro entrepreneurship, education, 
and attitudinal changes are also important areas in which the 
private sector might well make significantly greater contribu- 
tions, but in the time available to us we have attempted to deal 
only with the highest priority areas and urge that further study 
be given to these additional subjects. 

It should be noted that our optimism about potential business 
involvement, in both jobs for the unemployed and economic 
development, is grounded upon continuation of essentially the 
same level of economic growth the Nation has experienced in 
the past eighteen months. Business interest is, obviously, affected 
by general economic conditions as well as by a specific monetary 
incentive. 

The Commission has received ample testimony that unem- 
ployment and underemployment are among the most persistent 
and serious grievances among many Negroes in the central cities 
which have experienced disorders in recent years. At the same 
time, job training and job development are the daily concern 
of profit-making enterprises and consequently are areas to which 
private companies can bring the greatest skill and ingenuity. 

It is estimated that some 500,000 unemployed persons may be 
characterized as "hard core" in the sense that they lack eighth 
grade literacy and mathematical skills, have only intermittent 
work histories at most, and often lack motivation to hold and 
perform a job. A substantial proportion of this group is Negro, 
male, and between the ages of approximately 18 and 25. The 
evidence before the Commission suggests that it is this group 
of late teenagers and young adults who are often the initial 
participants in civil disorders. A slum employment study by the 
Department of Labor in 1966 indicated that, as compared with 
an overall unemployment rate in the United States of 3.8 per- 
cent, the unemployment rate among nonwhite 16 to 19-year-old 
males was 26.5 percent, and among nonwhite 16 to 24-year-old 
males was 15.9 percent. Data collected by the Commission in 20 
cities which experienced racial disorder in 1967, including the 
most serious disorders, indicate that Negro males between the 
ages of 15 and 25 predominated among the rioters, that mort 
than 20 percent of the rioters were unemployed, and that when 
they were employed, they tended to be underemployed in the 
sense that their employment was intermittent and in low status, 
unskilled jobs. 

Experience over recent years with various experimental public 
and private employment techniques demonstrates to our satis- 
faction that on-the-job training by private employers offers a 
highly successful method of insuring ultimate placement of 
trainees, as compared with vocational school programs. The 
latter often fail to attract the hard-core unemployed person, who 
is likely to have been a dropout from public school and is gen- 
erally poorly motivated toward public educational institutions 
of any type. Institutional programs also leave unresolved the 
difficult problem of matching the trainee to the subsequent job. 
Public employment programs often tend to provide unsatisfying, 
dead-end jobs. 

In our recommendations we propose to deal primarily with 

561 


the 500,000 hard-core unemployed who have not yet been reached 
or placed in permanent employment by existing programs. By 
so zeroing-in, we do not intend to ignore the remaining approxi- 
mately million and a half jobless whom the U.S. Department of 
Labor estimates also "need help" with regard to employment. 
Nor do we intend to ignore the approximately 10 million under- 
employed, 6.5 million of whom work full-time and earn less than 
$3,000 annually, which is the Federally-defined poverty level for 
a family of four. 

Many members of these latter two groups, the unemployed 
who are not "hard core" in the sense of extreme disadvantage, 
and the underemployed, would undoubtedly also benefit from 
the kind of training which our recommendations would encour- 
age for the hard core. We would urge continuation and expan- 
sion of existing programs which are designed to reach these 
other two groups. In addition, we recommend consideration of 
extension to these two groups of the program we recommend 
for the hard core, perhaps with modifications. 

We do not intend with our program for the hard-core disad- 
vantaged to stimulate the "leap-frogging," by the hard-core 
unemployed, of the other two groups. Certainly the already 
employed must not lose their jobs in order to make room for the 
hard-core unemployed. Only a program which both upgrades 
the already employed and thereby creates openings for the hard 
core, or which creates new openings for the hard core, can sat- 
isfy this need. 

The other two groups are often disadvantaged by the inter- 
related problems of outright racial discrimination against those 
who are nonwhite, and unrealistic and unnecessarily high mini- 
mum qualifications for employment or promotion, which often 
have the effect of discriminating. For these groups, as for the 
hard-core, business must consider whether a criminal record 
should be a bar to the particular job, whether a high school 
diploma is an inflexibly necessary requirement, or whether a 
written examination is appropriate. During World War II, in- 
dustry successfully employed large numbers of the previously 
unemployed who were disadvantaged, by lowering standards such 
as these and by restructuring work patterns so that the job fit 
the level of available skill, not vice versa. 

That experience, and many others as well, amply demonstrate 
that racial and other stereotypes are false. The usual educational 
and other measures used for the population as a whole, when 
applied to the disadvantaged often ignore considerable intelli- 
gence and skill which are utilized instead in activity, often illegal, 
in the complex "system" of the ghetto streets. The existing Fed- 
eral, state and local laws against discrimination in employment 
should be observed and effectively but reasonably enforced. 

We are realistic about the problems involved in motivating 
and training these hard-core youngsters and young adults. Ex- 
perience with a number of programs, such as the Job Corps, the 
Neighborhood Youth Corps, and several Manpower Development 
and Training projects, demonstrates clearly that training and 
motivating this group is considerably more costly than in the 
case of either the labor force with which private enterprise nor- 

562 


mally operates or the trainees whom current Federally-assisted 
on-the-job training programs have generally tended to reach. 
Accordingly, we are convinced that the incentive necessary to 
induce a broad base of the free enterprise system to hire and 
train the hard-core unemployed will have to be increased corre- 
spondingly. 

Almost by definition, the new employee recruited from the 
hard-core will require substantially more basic job training than 
is provided today for unskilled workers who are not disadvan- 
taged. Although this is a function and a source of cost which 
employers have generally undertaken themselves, under the 
Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962 the Federal 
government has created an incentive for training by defraying 
a portion of such costs. 

Far more serious for the employer are the many supportive 
services which the hard-core require in order to make them 
amenable to employment and job training and the discipline of 
the work experience. In many cases the new employee recruited 
from the hard-core will require basic educational training, which 
employers have rarely been required to provide under normal 
labor market circumstances. In addition, the new employee will 
usually require counselling in regard to his willingness to work 
and in regard to aspects of his work habits which the employer 
normally takes for granted: for example, in dress, appearance, 
social relationships, money management, transportation, hygiene 
and health. These supportive services will therefore constitute a 
source of special cost to the employer. 

Tardiness and absenteeism are major problems for this group, 
who have previously found little social or economic benefit from 
conformity with the usual standards of commercial life. A num- 
ber of experiments, including the substantial experience of the 
Job Corps training centers, indicates that it is difficult to moti- 
vate hard-core youths to remain on the job for more than a few 
weeks. The productivity of trainees at any level is often minimal, 
but at this level, and with considerable disruption through tar- 
diness, absenteeism and turnover, the cost to the employer can, 
again, be especially burdensome. 

These special costs, of supportive services and loss of produc- 
tivity, will have to be adequately reimbursed by government in 
order to permit and stimulate business and industry of all types 
and sizes to hire and train members of the hard-core unem- 
ployed. Estimates of the total annual cost to the employer per 
hard-core trainee vary from $3000 to $5000, including $3000 or 
more in wages at the higher of the minimum wage or the pre- 
vailing wage, training costs, and supportive service costs, and 
assuming that marginal productivity is achieved during the 
training period in return for the employer's payment of wages. 

It must be recognized that a sure method for motivating the 
hard-core unemployed has yet to be devised. One basic minimum 
is already apparent from experimental programs: the job must 
not appear to the hard-core person to be a "dead-end" job. Since 
by definition he would not be eligible for even an entry-level job, 
he must be given job training. It must be made clear to him from 
the outset that his satisfactory performance at the entry level 
will result not only in continued employment after the training 
period but also in an opportunity for  advancement, ideally 

563 


through a clearly defined "job ladder" with step increases in both 
pay and responsibility. The fastest-growing area of private sector 
labor demand is in the service industries, rather than in manu- 
facturing; yet the problem of giving a sense of dignity to entry- 
level jobs is greatest in the service industries. 

We believe that, spurred by an adequate monetary incentive, 
many private employers can and will utilize sufficient ingenuity 
to meet these and other difficulties of motivating, training and 
retaining the hard-core in useful and productive jobs. The task 
is by no means an easy one, but we believe the private sector is 
capable of devising individual solutions adapted to the individual 
employee and company. A truly massive attempt has not yet 
been made to induce business to try this approach to the unem- 
ployment problem. We believe that it offers a realistic possibility 
of success. 

Even with an adequate monetary incentive to the employer, 
it must also be recognized that many of the hard-core may never 
be employable by private enterprise, either because they are not 
reached by the normal processes of the labor market or even 
stepped-up recruitment techniques, because once reached they 
are reluctant to accept employment, because the cost of training 
them exceeds even the most liberal reimbursement, or because 
they are unable to achieve an adequate level of productivity. For 
this most severely disadvantaged group, other alternatives will 
have to be considered. 

Effective administration of a monetary incentive is almost as 
important in attracting widespread business interest as the 
amount of the incentive itself. Monetary incentives to business 
might be provided in a number of ways. The government could 
guarantee business against various unusually high risks from 
investment in ghetto areas or, as has been attempted by the 
Office of Economic Opportunity in a few experimental cases, 
against the higher turnover and other loss resulting from 
employment of the hard core. The most direct technique for 
compensating business is a contract mechanism, under which 
reimbursement for costs in the particular case is made by a 
governmental agency to the private contractor. An indirect 
incentive can be provided through the tax system, either by way 
of a credit against net tax or through an additional expense 
deduction for a particular cost or through accelerated deprecia- 
tion for particular investments or some combination of these 
three. 

We are convinced that large numbers and many different 
types of business and industrial companies will participate in 
hiring and training the hard-core unemployed only if an incen- 
tive technique is devised which is as simple and automatic as 
possible. 

Experience since 1962 in the on-the-job training program 
under the Manpower Development and Training Act indicates 
that the government contract mechanism, in advance of employ- 
ment and training, is slow in attracting business interest. In part 
this is due to the need in a contracting system for a substantial 
promotional effort to bring the program to the attention of a 
large number of employers. In part it is due to the reluctance of 
many employers, once they learn of the program, to engage in 
protracted negotiations with a many-layered structure of local, 

564 


state and Federal authorities, all of whom must approve the 
contractual arrangements. Employers are also extremely reluc- 
tant to assume the burdensome paperwork requirements and 
corresponding additional overhead costs of any Federal con- 
tracting procedure. Executives are often apprehensive that a 
government contract will necessarily involve some loss of man- 
agement prerogatives over the productive process, especially be- 
cause government may seek to dictate in detail the content of 
the training to be given to employees. These factors appear to 
discourage even the largest industrial firms, but their negative 
impact is, naturally, magnified manyfold for medium and small- 
sized employers, who might otherwise absorb, in the aggregate, 
large numbers of the hard-core unemployed. It is possible that 
a simplified direct compensation technique could be devised 
which would minimize the negative features of contracting, but 
it is likely that most businessmen would still avoid this type of 
involvement with government. 

We believe that the single most powerful inducement for broad 
involvement of private enterprise in job training and job devel- 
opment lies in the use of a tax incentive. Neither a guarantee 
technique nor a contracting mechanism offers the same appeal 
to businessmen in enterprises of all sizes as does a tax incentive. 
Businessmen are convinced from past experience that tax incen- 
tives will be relatively simple, automatic and as self -enforcing 
as a government program can be, even as compared with a 
simplified direct compensation method. Accordingly, we recom- 
mend the following program of incentives to business and 
industry: 

1. Tax Incentive for Hard-Core Employment. 

First, the hard-core unemployed should be defined and identi- 
fied by a government agency, either the Federal-State Employ- 
ment Services or other local agencies, such as the community 
action agencies, whichever may in particular localities develop 
the capacity to reach out effectively to the hard-core unem- 
ployed. We do not believe that business can generally be ex- 
pected to perform this recruitment function efficiently within 
the ghetto. 

Second, an unemployed person once certified as hard-core 
should be issued a green card or other similar identifying docu- 
ment which he would present to an employer. 

Third, for each new employee furnishing a green card added 
to his payroll, the employer, would in turn receive a substantial 
credit against his corporate income tax for the year in which 
the employee was employed. The sole limitation upon the em- 
ployer would be that he not dismiss existing employees in order 
to hire green card employees. 

In order to stimulate efforts by the employer to devise tech- 
niques for motivating green card employees to remain on the 
job, the tax credit would not be allowed to the employer unless 
the employee were retained for at least six months. If he re- 
mained for six months, the employer would be entitled to a tax 
credit in the amount of 75 percent of the wages and fringe bene- 
fits paid to the employee during that period. From the outset, 
the employer would be required to pay the higher of the mini- 
mum wage or the prevailing wage for the occupation in ques- 
tion. 

565 


To encourage continued retention of the employee, the em- 
ployer would be entitled to a credit against tax in the amount 
of 50 percent of the wages and fringe benefits paid to the em- 
ployee during the second six months of employment, and 25 
percent of the wages and fringe benefits paid during the second 
year of employment. For example, an employer paying the min- 
imum wage of $1.60 per hour, or $3,328 per year to a full-time em- 
ployee, and no fringe benefits, would receive for the first six 
months of employment $1,248 in credit against his net corpor- 
ate income tax. If the employee were retained for the second 
six months, the employer would receive an additional $832 or a 
total of $2,080 as a credit against tax for the first year. If the 
employee remained for the entire two-year period, the em- 
ployer would receive an additional $832 in credit against his 
corporate tax for the second year. The employer's total credit 
for the employee over a two-year period would thus amount to 
$2,912. Of course, over the two-year period the employer will 
incur the cost of training and other supportive services and the 
cost of wages and fringe benefits paid and would therefore also 
receive the usual deduction from gross income for these costs 
as business expenses. 

The premise of the plan is that, given the tax benefit only if 
the employee is motivated to remain on the job, the employer 
will attempt to create the conditions necessary to keep the em- 
ployee motivated, through the provision of training, job ladders, 
and the supportive services which have been described above as 
so necessary to motivation arid retention of the hard-core un- 
employed. In order to avoid abuse of the premium which the 
green card confers upon the job applicant, no green card holder 
would be entitled to use the card for more than two years of 
cumulative employment and in no event for a series of less- 
than-six-month periods with different employers. Should an 
employee leave an employer voluntarily for the second time, the 
Employment Service or other referring agencies would be re- 
quired to place him at the bottom of their referral file. 

As in the case of the existing 7 percent tax credit for invest- 
ment in new equipment, the maximum credit allowable against 
the corporate employer's tax arising from employment of the 
hard-core unemployed would be limited to $25,000 plus 50% of 
the amount of the company's tax exceeding $25,000. So that no 
employer would receive a competitive advantage, credit would 
be allowable only for a limited percentage of the total number 
of the company's employees, on a sliding scale. An employer of 
ten or fewer employees could receive a tax credit for no more 
than 50% of his employees as green card holders; employers of 
ten to one-hundred employees could receive credit for no more 
than 25%; and those employing over one hundred no more 
than 15%. 

An advantage of the tax credit route is that only companies 
which are profitable and therefore owe Federal income tax are 
eligible for the incentive credit. Profitable companies are in the 
best position to provide meaningful and continuing employment 

Provision should be made for exemption of green card holders 
from mandatory labor union membership until they have be- 
come permanent, full-time employees.

2. Tax Incentives for Investment in Poverty Areas, Both 
Urban and Rural. 

We recommend a parallel tax credit, in addition, for the loca- 
tion and renovation of plants and other business facilities in 
urban and rural poverty areas, as already defined jointly by sev- 
eral Federal departments and agencies. The new investment 
credit would be available for investments in rural as well as 
urban poverty areas in order to begin a national effort to improve 
rural economic conditions and thereby attempt to stem the mas- 
sive migration from such areas to the urban centers which has 
been so marked in recent decades. 

The existing incentive tax credit for investment in new equip- 
ment, first enacted in 1962, applies regardless of the area in 
which the investment is made. But the existing credit does not 
apply to investment in real property or in plant. We recommend 
that, for investment in poverty areas, the existing credit be in- 
creased substantially enough to achieve this purpose and ex- 
tended to investments in real property and plant, whether for 
acquisition or construction of new property or the renovation 
of existing property. We also recommend that plant and equip- 
ment in such areas be eligible for rapid amortization, within as 
little as five years. These incentives would be designed to at- 
tract to the poverty areas the type of industrial and commercial 
development which would create new jobs and would also stimu- 
late further economic benefit within the disadvantaged com- 
munity surrounding the enterprise. 

The incentives would assist existing businesses in poverty 
areas, including Negro-owned businesses, as well as new busi- 
nesses. By stimulating new jobs in urban poverty areas the in- 
centives would also help to overcome the often severe difficulties 
residents of those areas now experience in obtaining transpor- 
tation to suburban commercial and industrial plants. 

The credit for poverty area investment would not, however, 
be dependent upon employment of the hard-core unemployed. 
An employer eligible for the credit for poverty area investment 
would also be eligible, if he employed green card holders, for the 
credit for hard-core employment. The two credits are designed to 
meet separate needs and different costs to investors and em- 
ployers and therefore should be cumulative. Like the credit for 
employment of the hard-core, the investment credit should be 
limited to $25,000 of tax and 50 percent of the tax exceeding 
$25,000. 

Protections would have to be provided against subsidizing 
"run-away" plants from urban areas, although large companies 
should not be discouraged from expanding their operations into 
rural areas. Protections would also be necessary to avoid abuse 
of the credit by automated operations which involve few em- 
ployees. 

3. Local Joint Clearinghouse Groups. 

We recommend that industry, organized labor, and various 
civic organizations be encouraged to create joint local clearing- 
house groups to exchange experience gained with employment 
of the hard-core unemployed and with investment in poverty 
areas. A major benefit of utilizing the tax incentive technique is 
permitting each enterprise to adapt its program to the par- 
ticular conditions of its business and location and the particular 

567 


problems and strengths of the labor market in that location. 
However, there is much to be gained from the cross-fertilization 
of the many experimental programs now being carried on by 
business and industry and the many additional experiments 
which would be stimulated by the tax incentives we have out- 
lined. Mixed local groups would facilitate a useful interchange 
of experience and know-how. In any event, these local groups 
would have no authority to approve or disapprove programs for 
tax credit purposes. 

In our deliberations we have considered carefully the argu- 
ments which have repeatedly been made in some tax circles 
against the use of tax incentives for social purposes such as 
those we recommend. Two such arguments have been made 
most strenuously and merit thoughtful answers: 

(1) Backdoor Financing. It is often contended that tax in- 
centives, once enacted as a part of the Internal Revenue Code, 
become entrenched and immune from the kind of public scru- 
tiny which more direct incentives, through appropriated funds, 
receive annually in the Congress. The recent history of the 
existing 7 percent investment credit for new equipment, which 
is the most direct analogy to the investment credits proposed 
here, belies this argument. A fixed time limitation may be 
placed upon a provision of the tax law, just as in the case of 
authorizing legislation for a direct incentive. Although this was 
not done in the case of the 7 percent equipment investment 
credit, the Administration recommended a suspension of the 
credit for a period of time in 1966 and 1967, because the demon- 
strated success of the tax credit as a spur to new investment 
was thought to increase the danger of inflation. The Congress 
accepted this conclusion, after giving it the same consideration 
it would have given had the question instead arisen in regard 
to the extension of an authorized direct incentive or in regard 
to an appropriation for a program of direct incentive enacted 
under a multi-year authorization. The public policy which 
dictates that an incentive be a permanent part of the law is the 
same whether the law involved is the Internal Revenue Code or 
some other statute. 

The tax incentives we recommend should be limited in time 
and reappraised every two years. If, in addition, some further 
control on the cost to the Treasury is necessary, the government 
would retain authority to regulate the flow of green cards in the 
case of the credit for hard-core employment. 

(2) Foreclosing Other, More Creative Avenues of Assistance. 
It is contended that tax incentives tend to obscure the search 
for more effective techniques to achieve common social goals. 
This may be an effective argument in regard to other uses of 
tax incentives, but it is inapplicable to the use we recommend. 
We arrived at the tax approach only after carefully appraising 
the various other available means of governmental assistance, 
several of which have been tried. After weighing these alterna- 
tives, we have come to the firm conclusion that the tax tech- 
nique is indeed the most effective for the particular social goal. 
We have sought a means of motivating the widest possible spec- 
trum of American business in alleviating joblessness in our 
urban and rural poverty areas, and we find that no other tech- 

568 


nique is as likely to move the American business community 
into action for this purpose as is the tax-incentive device. 

The public policy goal here is the employment and training 
of hundreds of thousands of persons by, hopefully, thousands 
of business enterprises. The existing investment tax credit was 
taken on 1,239,000 corporate tax returns and 6,904,000 individual 
tax returns during the period of 1962-1965, representing new in- 
vestments in the amount of approximately 75 billion dollars and 
17.5 billion dollars respectively. It is precisely because of the need 
for a similarly pluralistic and large-scale answer to the problem 
of joblessness in the ghetto that we have turned to the most 
pluralistic technique for channelling governmental assistance: 
the individual decisions of thousands of businesses to utilize 
the tax credit in making their daily employment and plant lo- 
cation decisions. Other incentive techniques may be better for 
the solution of other major social problems, but we are con- 
vinced that the tax incentive method is the most appropriate 
and most hopeful solution to this particular problem.

Appendix I: Special Interim Recommendations of the 

Commission: Letters to the President on the National 

Guard and on Conferences for Police and Mayors; 

Letters to FCC and Department of Justice 

The President 
The White House 
Washington, D.C. 

August 10, 1967 
Dear Mr. President: 

On the basis of the testimony to date, the National Advisory 
Commission on Civil Disorders recommends that the following 
actions be taken immediately: 

(1) Increase substantially the recruitment of Negroes into the 
Army National Guard and Air National Guard. As of December 
31, 1966, the Army National Guard totaled 404,996 officers and 
enlisted personnel in units in the United States. Of this total, 
only 4,638 were Negro — 1.15%. As of the same date, the Air 
National Guard totaled 80,822 officers and airmen. Of this total, 
only 475 were Negro — .6%. 

The Commission believes strongly that this deficiency must 
be corrected as soon as possible. To do so will require the com- 
bined efforts of the Department of Defense, State officials, and 
the Negro community. 

(2) Improve and expand riot control training of the Army 
National Guard and the Air National Guard. We have been 
informed that steps are under way to do this. We wish to under- 
score the importance of moving forward as rapidly as possible. 
We recommend that special emphasis be given to such training 
during the next several weeks. 

(3) Review by Federal and State officials of the qualifications 
and performance of all officers in the Army National Guard and 
Air National Guard. The Department of Defense should also 
review federal recognition standards and procedures to insure 
that they are adequate to preclude the appointment and pro- 
motion of substandard officers. 

Respectfully yours, 

/s/ Otto Kerner 
Governor, Illinois

The President 
The White House 
Washington, D. C. 


October 7, 1967 


Dear Mr. President: 

The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, on the 
basis of testimony thus far received, recommends that you direct 
the Department of Justice to conduct a series of intensive train- 
ing conferences this winter for governmental and police officials. 
The series would focus on effective measures for the maintenance 
of law and order and on programs to improve police-community 
relations. 

We emphasize that knowledge and programs in these areas 
are not substitutes for solutions to the problems of racial dis- 
crimination, alienation and poverty, as reflected in such areas 
as employment, education and housing. But there is need for 
cities, as soon as possible, to share the knowledge that has been 
gained in methods for maintenance of law and order. 

Some seventy-five witnesses, including mayors, chiefs of police, 
other state and local officials, representatives of federal depart- 
ments and agencies, and residents of disorder areas have now 
testified before the Commission. Many others will be heard. 

The testimony to date convinces the Commission that a sub- 
stantial body of knowledge now exists in the fields of prevention 
and control of civil disorders that could profitably be communi- 
cated through training conferences under the auspices of the 
Department of Justice. Of course, we are aware that a number 
of valuable meetings and programs for local law enforcement 
officials are under way. But these meetings we believe can be 
significantly supplemented by a conference of broader scope and 
longer duration such as that we here propose. 

The precise format of this conference and the cities to be 
involved would, of course, be determined by the Justice Depart- 
ment. The conference could be conducted here in Washington 
or on a regional basis, perhaps in cooperation with colleges or 
universities. A short program might be appropriate for key state 
and municipal officials, a slightly longer one for police chiefs, 
and a more extensive one for other public safety and government 
personnel. Subjects to be covered presumably would include 
advance planning; control techniques; communications systems; 
decision making during disorders; joint operations with neigh- 
boring police, state police, the National Guard and Army; com- 
munity relations and effective means of dealing with citizens' 
grievances. 

Respectfully yours,

Honorable Ramsey Clark 
Attorney General 
Washington, D.C. 20530 


February 7, 1968 


Dear Mr. Attorney General: 

More effective means of communication among police officers 
in a disorder area and between police in the area and officers at 
control headquarters are essential. Difficulties in communication 
impair day-to-day enforcement efforts, but become particularly 
acute during a disorder when there is urgent need for depart- 
ments to act as coordinated units. 

One important way to alleviate this problem is to provide 
miniaturized two-way radio equipment for all officers on patrol. 
Accordingly, the Commission's Report will include the following 
paragraph strongly endorsing the recommendation of the Presi- 
dent's Crime Commission: 

Miniaturized communications equipment for officers 
on foot is critically needed for command and control in 
civil disorders. This Commission, therefore, endorses the 
recommendations made by the Crime Commission that 
the Federal Government assume the leadership in initi- 
ating and funding portable radio development programs 
for the police. 
The Commission believes that the Department of Justice 
should move forward now to develop such a program. We urge 
immediate action and we would appreciate learning of steps be- 
ing taken in this direction. 

Sincerely yours, 

/s/ Otto Kerner

February 7, 1968 
Honorable Rosel H. Hyde 

Chairman, Federal Communications Commission 
Washington, D.C. 

Dear Mr. Chairman: 

The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders has 
examined the critical control problems that our cities have en- 
countered in the recent disorders. Among the most perplexing 
has been to provide sufficient radio frequencies to insure com- 
munication among control officers on a daily basis and especially 
during a disorder. Police officers in the disorder area have fre- 
quently found it difficult or impossible to reach other officers or 
other agencies of local or state government. State and local police 
are sometimes unable to use the same frequency. 

The following paragraph, which will be included in the Com- 
mission's report, sets forth the Commission's strong recommen- 
dation on the basis of its study: 

We believe that the critical communications and con- 
trol problems arising from the present shortage of fre- 
quencies available to police departments require imme- 
diate attention. Accordingly, we recommend that the 
Federal Communications Commission make sufficient 
frequencies available to police and related public safety 
services to meet the demonstrated need for riot control 
and other emergency use. 
We understand that this matter is under consideration by the 
Commission now. We urge immediate action and would appre- 
ciate learning of steps being taken in this direction. 

Sincerely, 

/s/ Otto Kerner 
Chairman 

/s/ John V. Lindsay 
Vice Chairman

Appendix J: A Statement on Methodology 

Two prime factors shaped the character and direction of the 
Commission's work. The first was time; the second, the scope of 
the task. 

The Commission was established by the President on July 29, 
1967. Under the terms of the Executive Order, it was directed to 
make an interim report not later than March 1, 1968, and a final 
report not later than July 29, 1968. 

From the start, a sense of urgency dominated the Commis- 
sion's work. This grew from month to month until in December, 
the decision was made to issue both the interim and final reports 
as a single document before March 1, 1968. Basic to this decision 
was the conviction that to present our major conclusions and 
recommendations in mid-summer would be to forfeit whatever 
opportunity might exist for the report "to affect this year the 
dangerous climate of tension and apprehension that pervades 
our cities." 

At the same time, the Commission was faced with the task 
of analyzing a series of essentially local events, reporting "what 
happened" and "why it happened" in terms that would provide 
a national perspective. It also had responsibility to formulate 
a series of recommendations to answer the question "what can 
be done to prevent it from happening again and again." 

The Work of the Commissioners 

To accomplish these tasks within the stringent time limits 
indicated above, the Commissioners divided their work into two 
basic phases. 

During the first phase, closed hearings were held in Wash- 
ington, D.C., in order to bring before the Commission a full 
spectrum of witnesses whose testimony would aid the Commis- 
sion in considering the issues raised by the Presidents charge. 

In the initial hearings, the Commission sought information to 
determine as accurately as possible what happened during sev- 
eral major disorders. The Commission heard testimony from 
mayors and their top assistants, from police and fire department 
officials, from officers and workers of Human Relations Commis- 
sions, and from a variety of other local officials who either played 
a role in controlling the disorders, or had knowledge of the events 
that took place. For some major disorders, the Commission also 
heard testimony from federal officials, from governors, from 
other state officials, and from state law enforcement officers. 

This testimony was not confined solely to what happened. In 
prepared statements and during questioning by the Commission, 
these officials also explained their understanding of the basic 
causes of the disorders, and their recommendations for future 
action. 

In attempting to gain an understanding of the forces that 

574 


gave rise to the disorders, the Commission heard testimony from 
ghetto residents, from civil rights leaders, from noted authors, 
from reporters, from sociologists, historians, psychologists, econ- 
omists, and from a wide range of federal, state and local officials 
involved in the problems of our cities, our poor, and our minority 
groups. 

Because of the extreme importance of measures relating to 
the prevention and control of disorders, the Commission heard 
testimony from officials of the Department of Justice and the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, from army officers with respon- 
sibility for riot control operations, from National Guard officers 
who commanded control forces, and from a wide variety of police 
officials and academic experts in police-community relations. 

The Commission heard extensive testimony to provide the 
background for its program recommendations. In these various 
fields — employment, education, housing, welfare, youth pro- 
grams, urban problems — the Commission heard testimony from 
Cabinet officials, from other federal officials, from business and 
labor leaders, from ghetto residents, from state and local officials, 
from civil rights leaders, and from university experts. 

In total, during 20 days of hearings from August to November, 
over 130 persons appeared as witnesses before the Commission. 
The transcript of these hearings — which totaled over 3,900 pages 
— was digested and fully indexed so that it could serve as a 
continuing source of information for the Commission, staff, con- 
sultants, and advisers. 

A list of the witnesses appearing before the Commission is 
found in Appendix E. 

In addition to the hearings, the Commissioners themselves 
visited some eight cities that had suffered serious disorders. 
During these visits the Commissioners met with and interviewed 
ghetto residents and black militants, as well as public officials. 
Tours were conducted of areas that had experienced disorders. 

The second phase of the Commission's work consisted of a 
series of meetings held from December through February of 
1968 for the purpose of discussing the results of the field surveys 
and other investigations, reviewing preliminary drafts of sections 
of the report, and discussing and formulating proposed recom- 
mendations. 

In addition to these general meetings attended by the Com- 
mission and key staff members, individual Commissioners par- 
ticipated in preparation of the report by exchanging information 
with the staff, by furnishing data on particular subjects under 
review, and by generally furnishing advice and guidance to the 
staff effort. 

In sum, during the period from July 29, 1967, to March 1, 1968, 
the Commission met for a total of 44 days, not including the 
trips taken to the riot cities. 

The Staff 

The pressures of time and the need to study a representative 
sample of the riot cities led the Commission to recruit rapidly 
a staff of over 90 professionals, including qualified personnel, 
both professional and clerical, detailed to the Commission by 
federal agencies. 

575 


As the Commission's work shifted into its second phase, and 
as the investigative and analytical work neared completion, the 
staff was reduced in number to approximately 45 professionals. 

Shortly after the appointment of the Commission, the Presi- 
dent appointed David Ginsburg, a Washington attorney, as 
Executive Director, to direct the staff effort. He was assisted by 
the Deputy Executive Director, Victor H. Palmieri, a Los Angeles 
attorney and businessman. 

Merle M. McCurdy, on leave of absence as United States 
Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, served as the General 
Counsel for the Commission. He and his staff furnished legal 
advice to the Commission, arranged for and conducted the Com- 
mission hearings and conducted depositions as part of the inves- 
tigative efforts. 

Stephen Kurzman, a Washington attorney, supervised the 
field surveys conducted by the Commission, and the analysis of 
the data collected by these surveys. 

Staff efforts in the various substantive and analytical areas 
of the Commission's work were directed by a number of experts. 
Dr. Robert Shellow, a social psychologist with the National Insti- 
tute of Mental Health, directed portions of the analytical effort 
conducted by the staff. The staff work concerning police and 
public safety was the responsibility of Arnold Sagalyn, former 
Director of the Office of Law Enforcement Coordination for the 
Treasury Department, on leave of absence as an advisor on 
public safety for the Department of Housing and Urban Devel- 
opment. 

Robert Conot, author and journalist, directed the work of the 
staff in preparing the riot profiles. Milan C. Miskovsky, on leave 
as Assistant General Counsel of the Department of Treasury, 
served as Director of Investigations. Staff work in the develop- 
ment of social and economic program recommendations was 
directed by Dr. Richard Nathan, an economist and associate of 
the Brookings Institution, and Dr. Anthony Downs, economist. 

The Commission also relied heavily on the talents of the con- 
sultants and advisers named in Appendix F. They included ex- 
perts on all facets of the problems studied by the Commission, 
including leading scholars, police and other law enforcement 
officials, a variety of experts from local, state, and federal gov- 
ernment agencies, and specialists from private research firms. 
Some of these experts prepared drafts of chapters of the report, 
submitted papers, or conducted studies especially for the Com- 
mission. 

Commission Investigative Efforts 

The Commission undertook three major field research pro- 
grams. 

The primary investigative effort consisted of field surveys 
conducted in 23 cities. After consultation with staff researchers, 
the Commission concluded that within the short time period 
available, a national perspective could best be obtained by an 
intensive study of a representative group of cities that experi- 
enced some sort of disorder in 1967. Disturbances that took place 
in over 150 cities were initially ranked on the basis of the degree 

576 


of violence and damage, the duration of the violent action, the 
number of active participants, and the level of law enforcement 
response. From this list, Commission researchers selected for 
field investigation: 

• nine cities experiencing serious destruction. 

• three cities where the disorders occurred in university 
settings. 

• a chain of six New Jersey cities surrounding Newark. 

• five cities which experienced lesser degrees of violence. 

For each of the 23 cities, the staff first collected and reviewed 
existing written material on the disorders — FBI and Department 
of Justice reports, reports prepared by other government agen- 
cies, and newspaper accounts. This review was supplemented by 
oral briefings from those with special knowledge of one or more 
of the 23 cities. 

Over a period of several months, investigative teams of six 
staff members were dispatched to 20 of the 23 cities. (Investiga- 
tion of the three university disturbances was contracted to a 
nonprofit corporation.) In each city, subteams of two staff mem- 
bers interviewed persons from the official sector (mayors, city 
officials, policemen and police officials, judges, and others) , the 
disorder area (residents, leaders of community groups) and the 
private sector (businessmen, labor and community leaders) . In 
order to increase uniformity of the investigative effort, each 
six-man team was dispatched to a number of cities. 

During the city visits, team members interviewed over 1,200 
persons. All interviews followed, to the fullest extent possible, 
questionnaires developed by staff members working in the vari- 
ous substantive areas studied by the Commission. 

After completion of interviews in a city, team members re- 
turned to Washington to dictate reports of their interviews. Team 
members were also fully debriefed by oral questioning by staff 
members. 

A draft report was prepared synthesizing the team interviews 
for each city. Follow-up visits to a number of cities were con- 
ducted to obtain additional information. 

The field investigative effort thus produced information in two 
areas: first, chronology of each disorder, beginning with the 
events leading to the outbreak, through the development in its 
various stages, to the resolution and aftermath; second, the fac- 
tors responsible for the tension leading to disorder, including 
grievances in the Negro community, and the responses of offi- 
cials. A national perspective, as well as evidence of specific 
events, was obtained. 

The second major investigative effort went into the develop- 
ment of the riot profiles, a detailed study of nine disorders. This 
study focused on an identification and classification of the key 
actors and critical points in the disorders. It took advantage of 
all the material developed by the field surveys, but also con- 
ducted independent investigations. 

To ensure absolute accuracy each riot profile was thoroughly 
reviewed by the General Counsel and his staff. All statements 
that were not substantiated by sworn testimony, or by well- 

577 


known facts, were isolated, and potential verifying witnesses 
identified. 

Attorneys from the General Counsel's staff subpoenaed these 
witnesses for depositions, and in a series of city visits, obtained 
nearly 1,500 pages of sworn testimony from 90 witnesses to vali- 
date all material assertions in the Riot Profiles. 

The third major investigative effort sought to determine to 
what extent, if any, there was planning or organization in the 
riots. The methodology of this investigation is set out in the 
chapter on organized activity. Depositions and interviews con- 
ducted in connection with the General Counsel's Office aug- 
mented this investigation. 

A number of other specialized studies were conducted during 
preparation of the report, or have been contracted to outside 
consultants for later completion. These studies include, for 
example, an analysis of three disorders that took place in uni- 
versity settings, a comprehensive study of riot arrestees in over 
20 disturbances occurring over the past three years, and a com- 
puter examination of the effectiveness of police-community re- 
lations programs. 

In addition, the Commission has undertaken two major sur- 
veys of Negro and white attitudes with the aid of the Ford 
Foundation. The first, a survey of white and Negro attitudes in 
15 major cities and four suburban areas is being conducted by 
the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan. The 
second, under the direction of Professors Peter Rossi and James 
Coleman, Johns Hopkins University, is a continuation of the 
Commission's field effort — a special survey of attitudes of com- 
munity leaders, elected officials, administrators, policemen on 
the beat and teachers. The Commission is deeply indebted to the 
Ford Foundation for its assistance and support. 

Analytical Studies 

To describe and explain the disorders and to identify operative 
factors during the period of disorder, the data collected and 
compiled by field investigators were analyzed by staff social sci- 
entists and consultants. The analysis concentrated on collective 
behavior, leadership structures, the bargaining process operating 
in the disorders, and the causative factors of the disorders. De- 
tailed analyses of selected cities, and a comprehensive analysis 
of all disorders studies, were prepared. 

The data obtained from the field investigations were further 
analyzed by the staff and consultants in preparing the chapter 
on patterns of disorder. Results obtained from a special survey 
based on probability samples of residents in Detroit and Newark 
augmented this analysis. A methodology for this survey is set 
out in the chapter. 

In cooperation with the Bureau of the Census, the staff de- 
veloped socio-economic profiles for each of the 23 cities studied 
by the Commission. Primarily based upon 1960 Census informa- 
tion, these profiles included statistics on total population, age 
distribution, education, size of households, income, employment, 
type of employment, and housing. Separate information on white 
and non-white population was developed for the city studied, 
the standard metropolitan statistical area containing the city, 

578 


and the census tracts within the city where the disturbance took 
place. Whenever possible, census data were updated by more 
recent information. 

Program Studies 

The remaining staff and consultant efforts focused on the 
major substantive problem areas delineated in the President's 
charge to the Commission. 

The chapter on the police and the community was the product 
of a joint effort of the staff and a large number of consultants 
and advisers. Initially, a number of academic experts, including 
many who had served as staff members, consultants or advisers 
to the Crime Commission, submitted original papers analyzing a 
variety of problems in police-community relations. 

The chapter on control of disorder contains a distillation of 
some of the extensive material in the control supplement, but 
with special emphasis on the means by which police — and public 
officials — can control incidents or disorders in their early stages. 
A summary of the Methodology is contained in a footnote to 
the chapter. 

For the control chapter and supplement, the basic data on 
police departments were obtained from a survey of 28 city and 
two state police departments1 conducted for the Commission 
by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) . The 
survey information, which was obtained from interviews con- 
ducted by experienced police personnel, was analyzed by the 
IACP staff, and a report prepared assessing the state of pre- 
paredness and control capabilities of these police departments. 
The survey and report also covered police-community relations 
programs and training, information on policy guidelines, and 
data on Negro personnel in police departments. 

A two-day conference attended by police officials from several 
leading departments was held for the purpose of reviewing the 
lessons learned by police as a result of recent disorders. A Na- 
tional Guard Commander also participated in discussions relat- 
ing to police-Guard coordination and operations. A transcript 
of the conference was prepared to permit full review of the 
proceedings. 

The basic sources of data on the National Guard were: After 
Action Reports from a number of cities where Guard troops 
aided in control of disorders; the report on Detroit prepared by 
Cyrus R. Vance, Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense 
during the 1967 disorder; extensive information on the National 
Guard furnished by the National Guard Bureau and the Depart- 
ment of the Army; information from Commission investigations, 
analyses, riot profiles, and hearings; and information furnished 
by consultants and advisers.

In August of 1967, the Committee on Armed Services of the 
House of Representatives established a special subcommittee to 
inquire into the capability of the National Guard to cope with 
civil disturbances. The report and hearings of this subcommittee 
served as a valuable source of information on the Guard. 

An experienced Guard commander, who also served as a police 
commissioner, was retained as a consultant on National Guard 
matters. He, assisted by the staff, reviewed the information from 
the above sources, and submitted a report based upon this infor- 
mation and his own experience. 

Information about the Army was primarily supplied by the 
Department of Defense. Additional information was obtained 
from the Vance report on Detroit, and from Commission hear- 
ings. 

Information concerning fire department problems, and sug- 
gested recommendations, were primarily obtained from reports 
prepared by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), 
and by the Chief of the New York Fire Department. Additional 
information was obtained from reports prepared by fire depart- 
ment observers at several disorders. 

Reports were prepared for the Commission by the Public Ad- 
ministration Service (PAS) of Chicago, Illinois, (an organiza- 
tion that also developed information on coordination of police 
services for the Crime Commission) on intracity and interjuris- 
dictional coordinated planning at a horizontal level. In preparing 
these reports, PAS used information from the IACP survey of 
police departments as well as from its own resources. The De- 
partment of Justice furnished information concerning federal- 
state planning. 

Information on youth groups was obtained from the Commis- 
sion field investigations, and from a study prepared for the 
Commission by the Administration of Justice Unit of the Uni- 
versity Research Corporation. 

Basic information for the section on legal needs was obtained 
from the IACP survey, from a report prepared for the Commis- 
sion by the National League of Cities, Washington, D.C., and 
from the Department of Justice studies. Information from Com- 
mission investigations and hearings was also relied upon. 

Staff members prepared the initial drafts of the public safety 
sections using the above information. All or selected parts of 
these drafts were then submitted to a number of advisers for 
critical comment in order to ensure not only accuracy, but also 
full coverage of the subjects under investigation. 

The methodology for the media chapter, including the special 
study of television broadcasting and newspaper stories of the 
riots, is described in the chapter itself. 

Preparation of the remaining portions of Parts II and III of 
the report drew on the resources of the Commission, the staff, 
consultants, and advisers. Preliminary drafts were generally pre- 
pared based on outlines approved by the Commission and on 
readily available information. As the drafts progressed through 
the many revisions leading to a final product, data from the 
field investigations, hearings and special studies were gradually 
incorporated. Drafts were circulated among Commission mem- 
bers, other staff members, and consultants for comment. Advisers 

580 


submitted new ideas and information, and critical commentary. 
Also at this stage new data received from a variety of outside 
studies concerning the disorders were fed into the drafts. Finally, 
after thorough review and reworking by the members of the 
Commission, who spent 24 days in full Commission meetings 
reviewing, discussing and revising the drafts, the final versions 
were completed. 

In addition to the foregoing, two special advisory panels were 
formed by the Commission. On August 10, 1967, the President, 
after consulting with the Commission, appointed a separate and 
expert group, the National Advisory Panel on Insurance in Riot 
Affected Areas, to deal with the insurance problems of urban 
core residents and businessmen. 

The report of the Panel, "Meeting the Insurance Crisis of Our 
Cities," was separately published in January 1968. 

A second panel, the Advisory Panel on Private Enterprise, was 
formed under the chairmanship of Commissioner Thornton. The 
primary purpose of the Panel was "to assist the Commission 
and staff in formulating recommendations for increasing em- 
ployment opportunities." The members of the Panel included 
leading businessmen and academic experts. 

Acknowledgments 

Members of our investigative and research staff received co- 
operation from numerous persons who gave freely of their time 
and advice. Individuals are too numerous to mention, but we 
would like to thank generally the city officials, both elected and 
appointed, in the cities we visited. State and county officials 
throughout the country also cooperated with us, as did people 
throughout the federal government. 

Remington Arms Company, Inc. and the Winchester-Western 
Division of Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation also arranged 
for an independent study by Stanford Research Institute on the 
role of firearms in disorders, to be released by May 1, 1968.

THE FACTS BEHIND 


mm iiuii 


the horror of Watts was the first shattering 
revelation about America's racial crisis— and 
a grim prelude to the future. The summer of 
1967-in Newark, Detroit, Cleveland and 
across the nation-revealed the hitter, deep- 
rooted dissension in our cities, the result of 
over 300 years of inequities. **********

REPORT 


On Jul)' 29, 1967, President Lyndon B. John- 
son appointed a special commission of distin- 
guished Americans under Governor Otto 
Kerner of Illinois to search for the roots of 
the rising militancy in our country— and the 
widening gap between white and Negro 
Americans. Now, after seven months of pains- 
taking investigation, here are the dramatic 
answers. Here are the causes of and remedies 
for the smoldering violence in America today.
